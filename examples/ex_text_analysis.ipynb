       "['fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives   among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order  and received on the 14th day of the present month  on the one hand  i was summoned by my country  whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love  from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection  and  in my flattering hopes  with an immutable decision  as the asylum of my declining years    a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination  and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time  on the other hand  the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me  being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications  could not but overwhelm with despondence one who  inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration  ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies  in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected  all i dare hope is that if  in executing this task  i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances  or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow citizens  and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me  my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me  and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated   such being the impressions under which i have  in obedience to the public summons  repaired to the present station  it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe  who presides in the councils of nations  and whose providential aids can supply every human defect  that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes  and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge  in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good  i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own  nor those of my fellow citizens at large less than either  no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the united states  every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency  and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude  along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage  these reflections  arising out of the present crisis  have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed  you will join with me  i trust  in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence   by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president  to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient   the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled  and which  in defining your powers  designates the objects to which your attention is to be given  it will be more consistent with those circumstances  and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me  to substitute  in place of a recommendation of particular measures  the tribute that is due to the talents  the rectitude  and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them  in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments  no separate views nor party animosities  will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests  so  on another  that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality  and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world  i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire  since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness  between duty and advantage  between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity  since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained  and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered  perhaps  as deeply  as finally  staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people   besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care  it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system  or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them  instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject  in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities  i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good  for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government  or which ought to await the future lessons of experience  a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted   to the foregoing observations i have one to add  which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives  it concerns myself  and will therefore be as brief as possible  when i was first honored with a call into the service of my country  then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties  the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation  from this resolution i have in no instance departed  and being still under the impressions which produced it  i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department  and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require   having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together  i shall take my present leave  but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that  since he has been pleased to favor the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity  and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness  so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views  the temperate consultations  and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend   ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  i am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the functions of its chief magistrate  when the occasion proper for it shall arrive  i shall endeavor to express the high sense i entertain of this distinguished honor  and of the confidence which has been reposed in me by the people of united america   previous to the execution of any official act of the president the constitution requires an oath of office  this oath i am now about to take  and in your presence  that if it shall be found during my administration of the government i have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof  i may  besides incurring constitutional punishment  be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn ceremony     ',\n",
       " 'when it was first perceived  in early times  that no middle course for america remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims  men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country  relying  however  on the purity of their intentions  the justice of their cause  and the integrity and intelligence of the people  under an overruling providence which had so signally protected this country from the first  the representatives of this nation  then consisting of little more than half its present number  not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up  but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them  and launched into an ocean of uncertainty   the zeal and ardor of the people during the revolutionary war  supplying the place of government  commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society  the confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the batavian and helvetic confederacies  the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history  and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered  but reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day  it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable   negligence of its regulations  inattention to its recommendations  if not disobedience to its authority  not only in individuals but in states  soon appeared with their melancholy consequences    universal languor  jealousies and rivalries of states  decline of navigation and commerce  discouragement of necessary manufactures  universal fall in the value of lands and their produce  contempt of public and private faith  loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations  and at length in discontents  animosities  combinations  partial conventions  and insurrection  threatening some great national calamity   in this dangerous crisis the people of america were not abandoned by their usual good sense  presence of mind  resolution  or integrity  measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union  establish justice  insure domestic tranquillity  provide for the common defense  promote the general welfare  and secure the blessings of liberty  the public disquisitions  discussions  and deliberations issued in the present happy constitution of government   employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions  i first saw the constitution of the united states in a foreign country  irritated by no literary altercation  animated by no public debate  heated by no party animosity  i read it with great satisfaction  as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts  as an experiment better adapted to the genius  character  situation  and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested  in its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as i had ever most esteemed  and in some states  my own native state in particular  had contributed to establish  claiming a right of suffrage  in common with my fellow citizens  in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity  as well as them and theirs  i did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions  in public and in private  it was not then  nor has been since  any objection to it in my mind that the executive and senate were not more permanent  nor have i ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves  in the course of their experience  should see and feel to be necessary or expedient  and by their representatives in congress and the state legislatures  according to the constitution itself  adopt and ordain   returning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years  i had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things  and i have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the constitution  the operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends  and from an habitual attention to it  satisfaction in its administration  and delight in its effects upon the peace  order  prosperity  and happiness of the nation i have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it   what other form of government  indeed  can so well deserve our esteem and love   there may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences  but this is very certain  that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing  more noble  majestic  or august  than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other chamber of congress  of a government in which the executive authority  as well as that of all the branches of the legislature  are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good  can anything essential  anything more than mere ornament and decoration  be added to this by robes and diamonds  can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people  for it is the people only that are represented  it is their power and majesty that is reflected  and only for their good  in every legitimate government  under whatever form it may appear  the existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people  and what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind  if national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs  not from power or riches  grandeur or glory  but from conviction of national innocence  information  and benevolence   in the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free  fair  virtuous  and independent elections  if an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote  and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption  the government may be the choice of a party for its own ends  not of the nation for the national good  if that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces  by fraud or violence  by terror  intrigue  or venality  the government may not be the choice of the american people  but of foreign nations  it may be foreign nations who govern us  and not we  the people  who govern ourselves  and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance   such is the amiable and interesting system of government  and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed  which the people of america have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who  by a long course of great actions  regulated by prudence  justice  temperance  and fortitude  conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace  to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity  has merited the gratitude of his fellow citizens  commanded the highest praises of foreign nations  and secured immortal glory with posterity   in that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services  the gratitude of mankind  the happy fruits of them to himself and the world  which are daily increasing  and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year  his name may be still a rampart  and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark  against all open or secret enemies of his country s peace  this example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both houses of congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation   on this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence  but as something may be expected  the occasion  i hope  will be admitted as an apology if i venture to say that if a preference  upon principle  of a free republican government  formed upon long and serious reflection  after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth  if an attachment to the constitution of the united states  and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people  expressed in the mode prescribed in it  if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual states and a constant caution and delicacy toward the state governments  if an equal and impartial regard to the rights  interest  honor  and happiness of all the states in the union  without preference or regard to a northern or southern  an eastern or western  position  their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments  if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations  if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools  colleges  universities  academies  and every institution for propagating knowledge  virtue  and religion among all classes of the people  not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes  and of society in all its forms  but as the only means of preserving our constitution from its natural enemies  the spirit of sophistry  the spirit of party  the spirit of intrigue  the profligacy of corruption  and the pestilence of foreign influence  which is the angel of destruction to elective governments  if a love of equal laws  of justice  and humanity in the interior administration  if an inclination to improve agriculture  commerce  and manufacturers for necessity  convenience  and defense  if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of america  and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us  and our citizens to be more friendly to them  if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations  and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of europe which has been adopted by this government and so solemnly sanctioned by both houses of congress and applauded by the legislatures of the states and the public opinion  until it shall be otherwise ordained by congress  if a personal esteem for the french nation  formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them  and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations  if  while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of america and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved  an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint  if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellow citizens by whatever nation  and if success can not be obtained  to lay the facts before the legislature  that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the government and its constituents demand  if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me  at all times and to all nations  and maintain peace  friendship  and benevolence with all the world  if an unshaken confidence in the honor  spirit  and resources of the american people  on which i have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived  if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it  founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life  and not obscured but exalted by experience and age  and  with humble reverence  i feel it to be my duty to add  if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves christians  and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for christianity among the best recommendations for the public service  can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes  it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two houses shall not be without effect   with this great example before me  with the sense and spirit  the faith and honor  the duty and interest  of the same american people pledged to support the constitution of the united states  i entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy  and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power   and may that being who is supreme over all  the patron of order  the fountain of justice  and the protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty  continue his blessing upon this nation and its government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of his providence  ',\n",
       " 'friends and fellow citizens   called upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country  i avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me  to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents  and that i approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire  a rising nation  spread over a wide and fruitful land  traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry  engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right  advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye    when i contemplate these transcendent objects  and see the honor  the happiness  and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue  and the auspices of this day  i shrink from the contemplation  and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking  utterly  indeed  should i despair did not the presence of many whom i here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our constitution i shall find resources of wisdom  of virtue  and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties  to you  then  gentlemen  who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation  and to those associated with you  i look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world   during the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think  but this being now decided by the voice of the nation  announced according to the rules of the constitution  all will  of course  arrange themselves under the will of the law  and unite in common efforts for the common good  all  too  will bear in mind this sacred principle  that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail  that will to be rightful must be reasonable  that the minority possess their equal rights  which equal law must protect  and to violate would be oppression  let us  then  fellow citizens  unite with one heart and one mind  let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things  and let us reflect that  having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered  we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic  as wicked  and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions  during the throes and convulsions of the ancient world  during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man  seeking through blood and slaughter his long lost liberty  it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore  that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others  and should divide opinions as to measures of safety  but every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle  we have called by different names brethren of the same principle  we are all republicans  we are all federalists  if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form  let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it  i know  indeed  that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong  that this government is not strong enough  but would the honest patriot  in the full tide of successful experiment  abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this government  the world s best hope  may by possibility want energy to preserve itself  i trust not  i believe this  on the contrary  the strongest government on earth  i believe it the only one where every man  at the call of the law  would fly to the standard of the law  and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern  sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself  can he  then  be trusted with the government of others  or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him  let history answer this question   let us  then  with courage and confidence pursue our own federal and republican principles  our attachment to union and representative government  kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe  too high minded to endure the degradations of the others  possessing a chosen country  with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation  entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties  to the acquisitions of our own industry  to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens  resulting not from birth  but from our actions and their sense

necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people  still one thing more  fellow citizens    a wise and frugal government  which shall restrain men from injuring one another  shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement  and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned  this is the sum of good government  and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities   about to enter  fellow citizens  on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you  it is proper you should understand what i deem

principle  but not all its limitations  equal and exact justice to all men  of whatever state or persuasion  religious or political  peace  commerce  and honest friendship with all nations  entangling alliances with none  the support of the state governments in all their rights  as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies  the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor  as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad  a jealous care of the right of election by the people    a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided  absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority  the vital principle of republics  from which is no appeal but to force  the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism  a well disciplined militia  our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war  till regulars may relieve them  the supremacy of the civil over the military authority  economy in the public expense  that labor may be lightly burthened  the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith  encouragement of agriculture  and of commerce as its handmaid  the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason  freedom of religion  freedom of the press  and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus  and trial by juries impartially selected  these principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation  the wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment  they should be the creed of our political faith  the text of civic instruction  the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust  and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm  let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace  liberty  and safety   i repair  then  fellow citizens  to the post you have assigned me  with experience enough in subordinate offices to

bring him into it  without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary character  whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place in his country s love and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history  i ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs  i shall often go wrong through defect of judgment  when right  i shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the whole ground  i ask your indulgence for my own errors  which will never be intentional  and your support against the errors of others  who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts  the approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past  and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance  to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power  and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all   relying  then  on the patronage of your good will  i advance with obedience to the work  ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice it is in your power to make  and may that infinite power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best  and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity     ',\n",
       " 'proceeding  fellow citizens  to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred on me  it is my duty to express the deep sense i entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large  and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations   on taking this station on a former occasion i declared the principles on which i believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth  my conscience tells me i have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind   in the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations  and especially of those with which we have the most important relations  we have done them justice on all occasions  favored where favor was lawful  and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms  we are firmly convinced  and we act on that conviction  that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties  and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others   at home  fellow citizens  you best know whether we have done well or ill  the suppression of unnecessary offices  of useless establishments and expenses  enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes  these  covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions  had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property and produce  if among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient  it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them  and because  if they had any merit  the state authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved   the remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts  being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only  and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens  it may be the pleasure and the pride of an american to ask  what farmer  what mechanic  what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the united states  these contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the government  to fulfill contracts with foreign nations  to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits  to extend those limits  and to apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their final redemption  and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby liberated may  by a just repartition of it among the states and a corresponding amendment of the constitution  be applied in time of peace to rivers  canals  roads  arts  manufactures  education  and other great objects within each state  in time of war  if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war  increased as the same revenue will be by increased population and consumption  and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis  it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past  war will then be but a suspension of useful works  and a return to a state of peace  a return to the progress of improvement   i have said  fellow citizens  that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits  but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on  and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest  in all events  it will replace the advances we shall have made  i know that the acquisition of louisiana had been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union  but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively  the larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions  and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family  with which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse   in matters of religion i have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government  i have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it  but have left them  as the constitution found them  under the direction and discipline of the church or state authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies   the aboriginal inhabitants of these countries i have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires  endowed with the faculties and the rights of men  breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence  and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed  the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores  without power to divert or habits to contend against it  they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it  now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter s state  humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts  to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals  we have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use  we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity  and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves   but the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life  to induce them to exercise their reason  follow its dictates  and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter  they are combated by the habits of their bodies  prejudices of their minds  ignorance  pride  and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other  these persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors  that whatsoever they did must be done through all time  that reason is a false guide  and to advance under its counsel in their physical  moral  or political condition is perilous innovation  that their duty is to remain as their creator made them  ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger  in short  my friends  among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry  they too have their antiphilosophists who find an interest in keeping things in their present state  who dread reformation  and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates   in giving these outlines i do not mean  fellow citizens  to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures  that is due  in the first place  to the reflecting character of our citizens at large  who  by the weight of public opinion  influence and strengthen the public measures  it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties  it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected  who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws  the execution of which alone remains for others  and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries  whose patriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions   during this course of administration  and in order to disturb it  the artillery of the press has been leveled against us  charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare  these abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted  inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety  they might  indeed  have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several states against falsehood and defamation  but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants  and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation   nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully made  whether freedom of discussion  unaided by power  is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth    whether a government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution  with zeal and purity  and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness  can be written down by falsehood and defamation  the experiment has been tried  you have witnessed the scene  our fellow citizens looked on  cool and collected  they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded  they gathered around their public functionaries  and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage  they pronounced their verdict  honorable to those who had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes that he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs   no inference is here intended that the laws provided by the states against false and defamatory publications should not be enforced  he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law  but the experiment is noted to prove that  since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts  the press  confined to truth  needs no other legal restraint  the public judgment will correct false reasoning and opinions on a full hearing of all parties  and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness  if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain  its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion   contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course  i offer to our country sincere congratulations  with those  too  not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength  facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them  and our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens with whom they can not yet resolve to act as to principles and measures  think as they think and desire what they desire  that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good  that peace be cultivated  civil and religious liberty unassailed  law and order preserved  equality of rights maintained  and that state of property  equal or unequal  which results to every man from his own industry or that of his father s  when satisfied of these views it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them  in the meantime let us cherish them with patient affection  let us do them justice  and more than justice  in all competitions of interest  and we need not doubt that truth  reason  and their own interests will at length prevail  will gather them into the fold of their country  and will complete that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength   i shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me  and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved  i fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray  i am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice  but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests  i shall need  therefore  all the indulgence which i have heretofore experienced from my constituents  the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years  i shall need  too  the favor of that being in whose hands we are  who led our fathers  as israel of old  from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life  who has covered our infancy with his providence and our riper years with his wisdom and power  and to whose goodness i ask you to join in supplications with me that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants  guide their councils  and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good  and shall secure to you the peace  friendship  and approbation of all nations  ',\n",
       " 'unwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority  i avail myself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression made on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of which i am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions  so distinguished a mark of confidence  proceeding from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation  would under any circumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion  as well as filled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed  under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period  i feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced   the present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel and that of our own country full of difficulties  the pressure of these  too  is the more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a moment when the national prosperity being at a height not before attained  the contrast resulting from the change has been rendered the more striking  under the benign influence of our republican institutions  and the maintenance of peace with all nations whilst so many of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars  the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and resources  proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture  in the successful enterprises of commerce  in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts  in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt  and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land   it is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which has for some time been distressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views  nor  as i trust  on any involuntary errors in the public councils  indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations  it has been the true glory of the united states to cultivate peace by observing justice  and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality  if there be candor in the world  the truth of these assertions will not be questioned  posterity at least will do justice to them   this unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the belligerent powers  in their rage against each other  or impelled by more direct motives  principles of retaliation have been introduced equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledged law  how long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the demonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the united states  and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a revocation of them  can not be anticipated  assuring myself that under every vicissitude the determined spirit and united councils of the nation will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests  i repair to the post assigned me with no other discouragement than what springs from my own inadequacy to its high duties  if i do not sink under the weight of this deep conviction it is because i find some support in a consciousness of the purposes and a confidence in the principles which i bring with me into this arduous service   to cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions  to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nations  to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms  to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities  so degrading to all countries and so baneful to free ones  to foster a spirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others  too proud to surrender our own  too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves and too elevated not to look down upon them in others  to hold the union of the states as the basis of their peace and happiness  to support the constitution  which is the cement of the union  as well in its limitations as in its authorities  to respect the rights and authorities reserved to the states and to the people as equally incorporated with and essential to the success of the general system  to avoid the slightest interference with the right of conscience or the functions of religion  so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction  to preserve in their full energy the other salutary provisions in behalf of private and personal rights  and of the freedom of the press  to observe economy in public expenditures  to liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge of the public debts  to keep within the requisite limits a standing military force  always remembering that an armed and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of republics    that without standing armies their liberty can never be in danger  nor with large ones safe  to promote by authorized means improvements friendly to agriculture  to manufactures  and to external as well as internal commerce  to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty  to carry on the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state    as far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the fulfillment of my duty  they will be a resource which can not fail me   it is my good fortune  moreover  to have the path in which i am to tread lighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties by those who have marched before me  of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak  i may  however  be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my heart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved country  gratefully bestowed or exalted talents zealously devoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness   but the source to which i look or the aids which alone can supply my deficiencies is in the well tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow citizens  and in the counsels of those representing them in the other departments associated in the care of the national interests  in these my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed  next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that almighty being whose power regulates the destiny of nations  whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising republic  and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past  as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future  ',\n",
       " 'about to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me  i find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence and of the responsibility united with it  the impressions on me are strengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated  and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed  from the weight and magnitude now belonging to it i should be compelled to shrink if i had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people  and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation  which forms so prominent a feature in our situation  is stamped with that justice which invites the smiles of heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination   may we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the characters by which this war is distinguished   it was not declared on the part of the united states until it had been long made on them  in reality though not in name  until arguments and postulations had been exhausted  until a positive declaration had been received that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued  nor until this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down the spirit of the nation  destroying all confidence in itself and in its political institutions  and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe struggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers   on the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important class of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class  not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection  i need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones  nor paint the outrages inseparable from it  the proofs are in the records of each successive administration of our government  and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the american people have found their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature   as the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects  we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor  no usage of civilized nations  no precept of courtesy or humanity  have been infringed  the war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations  and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed   how little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy   they have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the united states not liable to be so considered under the usages of war   they have refused to consider as prisoners of war  and threatened to punish as traitors and deserters  persons emigrating without restraint to the united states  incorporated by naturalization into our political family  and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety  such is the avowed purpose of a government which is in the practice of naturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries  and not only of permitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native country   they have not  it is true  taken into their own hands the hatchet and the knife  devoted to indiscriminate massacre  but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments  have allured them into their service  and carried them to battle by their sides  eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives  and  what was never before seen  british commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates  and now we find them  in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare  supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society  to dismember our confederated republic  happily  like others  these will recoil on the authors  but they mark the degenerate counsels from which they emanate  and if they did not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as proceeding from a government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary   to render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous  the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress  the sword was scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed  still more precise advances were repeated  and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation   these resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue  our nation is in number more than half that of the british isles  it is composed of a brave  a free  a virtuous  and an intelligent people  our country abounds in the necessaries  the arts  and the comforts of life  a general prosperity is visible in the public countenance  the means employed by the british cabinet to undermine it have recoiled on themselves  have given to our national faculties a more rapid development  and  draining or diverting the precious metals from british circulation and british vaults  have poured them into those of the united states  it is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it  when the public voice called for war  all knew  and still know  that without them it could not be carried on through the period which it might last  and the patriotism  the good sense  and the manly spirit of our fellow citizens are pledges for the cheerfulness with which they will bear each his share of the common burden  to render the war short and its success sure  animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary  and the success of our arms now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to them  already have the gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element  if the reputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other  presaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting to correspondent triumphs there also but the discipline and habits which are in daily progress  ',\n",
       " 'i should be destitute of feeling if i was not deeply affected by the strong proof which my fellow citizens have given me of their confidence in calling me to the high office whose functions i am about to assume  as the expression of their good opinion of my conduct in the public service  i derive from it a gratification which those who are conscious of having done all that they could to merit it can alone feel  my sensibility is increased by a just estimate of the importance of the trust and of the nature and extent of its duties  with the proper discharge of which the highest interests of a great and free people are intimately connected  conscious of my own deficiency  i cannot enter on these duties without great anxiety for the result  from a just responsibility i will never shrink  calculating with confidence that in my best efforts to promote the public welfare my motives will always be duly appreciated and my conduct be viewed with that candor and indulgence which i have experienced in other stations   in commencing the duties of the chief executive office it has been the practice of the distinguished men who have gone before me to explain the principles which would govern them in their respective administrations  in following their venerated example my attention is naturally drawn to the great causes which have contributed in a principal degree to produce the present happy condition of the united states  they will best explain the nature of our duties and shed much light on the policy which ought to be pursued in future   from the commencement of our revolution to the present day almost forty years have elapsed  and from the establishment of this constitution twenty eight  through this whole term the government has been what may emphatically be called self government  and what has been the effect  to whatever object we turn our attention  whether it relates to our foreign or domestic concerns  we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in the excellence of our institutions  during a period fraught with difficulties and marked by very extraordinary events the united states have flourished beyond example  their citizens individually have been happy and the nation prosperous   under this constitution our commerce has been wisely regulated with foreign nations and between the states  new states have been admitted into our union  our territory has been enlarged by fair and honorable treaty  and with great advantage to the original states  the states  respectively protected by the national government under a mild  parental system against foreign dangers  and enjoying within their separate spheres  by a wise partition of power  a just proportion of the sovereignty  have improved their police  extended their settlements  and attained a strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholesome laws well administered  and if we look to the condition of individuals what a proud spectacle does it exhibit  on whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our union  who has been deprived of any right of person or property  who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he prefers to the divine author of his being  it is well known that all these blessings have been enjoyed in their fullest extent  and i add with peculiar satisfaction that there has been no example of a capital punishment being inflicted on anyone for the crime of high treason   some who might admit the competency of our government to these beneficent duties might doubt it in trials which put to the test its strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nations  here too experience has afforded us the most satisfactory proof in its favor  just as this constitution was put into action several of the principal states of europe had become much agitated and some of them seriously convulsed  destructive wars ensued  which have of late only been terminated  in the course of these conflicts the united states received great injury from several of the parties  it was their interest to stand aloof from the contest  to demand justice from the party committing the injury  and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all  war became at length inevitable  and the result has shown that our government is equal to that  the greatest of trials  under the most unfavorable circumstances  of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploits of the army  the navy  and the militia i need not speak   such  then  is the happy government under which we live    a government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed  a government elective in all its branches  under which every citizen may by his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the constitution  which contains within it no cause of discord  none to put at variance one portion of the community with another  a government which protects every citizen in the full enjoyment of his rights  and is able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign powers   other considerations of the highest importance admonish us to cherish our union and to cling to the government which supports it  fortunate as we are in our political institutions  we have not been less so in other circumstances on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend  situated within the temperate zone  and extending through many degrees of latitude along the atlantic  the united states enjoy all the varieties of climate  and every production incident to that portion of the globe  penetrating internally to the great lakes and beyond the sources of the great rivers which communicate through our whole interior  no country was ever happier with respect to its domain  blessed  too  with a fertile soil  our produce has always been very abundant  leaving  even in years the least favorable  a surplus for the wants of our fellow men in other countries  such is our peculiar felicity that there is not a part of our union that is not particularly interested in preserving it  the great agricultural interest of the nation prospers under its protection  local interests are not less fostered by it  our fellow citizens of the north engaged in navigation find great encouragement in being made the favored carriers of the vast productions of the other portions of the united states  while the inhabitants of these are amply recompensed  in their turn  by the nursery for seamen and naval force thus formed and reared up for the support of our common rights  our manufactures find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry  and the surplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in less favored parts at home   such  then  being the highly favored condition of our country  it is the interest of every citizen to maintain it  what are the dangers which menace us  if any exist they ought to be ascertained and guarded against   in explaining my sentiments on this subject it may be asked  what raised us to the present happy state  how did we accomplish the revolution  how remedy the defects of the first instrument of our union  by infusing into the national government sufficient power for national purposes  without impairing the just rights of the states or affecting those of individuals  how sustain and pass with glory through the late war  the government has been in the hands of the people  to the people  therefore  and to the faithful and able depositaries of their trust is the credit due  had the people of the united states been educated in different principles had they been less intelligent  less independent  or less virtuous can it be believed that we should have maintained the same steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success  while  then  the constituent body retains its present sound and healthful state everything will be safe  they will choose competent and faithful representatives for every department  it is only when the people become ignorant and corrupt  when they degenerate into a populace  that they are incapable of exercising the sovereignty  usurpation is then an easy attainment  and an usurper soon found  the people themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement and ruin  let us  then  look to the great cause  and endeavor to preserve it in full force  let us by all wise and constitutional measures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of preserving our liberties   dangers from abroad are not less deserving of attention  experiencing the fortune of other nations  the united states may be again involved in war  and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset our government  to break our union  and demolish us as a nation  our distance from europe and the just  moderate  and pacific policy of our government may form some security against these dangers  but they ought to be anticipated and guarded against  many of our citizens are engaged in commerce and navigation  and all of them are in a certain degree dependent on their prosperous state  many are engaged in the fisheries  these interests are exposed to invasion in the wars between other powers  and we should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if we did not expect it  we must support our rights or lose our character  and with it  perhaps  our liberties  a people who fail to do it can scarcely be said to hold a place among independent nations  national honor is national property of the highest value  the sentiment in the mind of every citizen is national strength  it ought therefore to be cherished   to secure us against these dangers our coast and inland frontiers should be fortified  our army and navy  regulated upon just principles as to the force of each  be kept in perfect order  and our militia be placed on the best practicable footing  to put our extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will be attended with expense  but the work when finished will be permanent  and it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to our own  aided by a few thousand land troops  would expose us to greater expense  without taking into the estimate the loss of property and distress of our citizens  than would be sufficient for this great work  our land and naval forces should be moderate  but adequate to the necessary purposes    the former to garrison and preserve our fortifications and to meet the first invasions of foreign foe  and  while constituting the elements of a greater force  to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implements of war in a state to be brought into activity in the event of war  the latter  retained within the limits proper in a state of peace  might aid in maintaining the neutrality of the united states with dignity in the wars of other powers and in saving the property of their citizens from spoliation  in time of war  with the enlargement of which the great naval resources of the country render it susceptible  and which should be duly fostered in time  of peace  it would contribute essentially  both as an auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance  to diminish the calamities of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination   but it ought always to be held prominently in view that the safety of these states and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an eminent degree on the militia  invasions may be made too formidable to be resisted by any land and naval force which it would comport either with the principles of our government or the circumstances of the united states to maintain  in such cases recourse must be had to the great body of the people  and in a manner to produce the best effect  it is of the highest importance  therefore  that they be so organized and trained as to be prepared for any emergency  the arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country  if formed on equal and just principles  it can not be oppressive  it is the crisis which makes the pressure  and not the laws which provide a remedy for it  this arrangement should be formed  too  in time of peace  to be the better prepared for war  with such an organization of such a people the united states have nothing to dread from foreign invasion  at its approach an overwhelming force of gallant men might always be put in motion   other interests of high importance will claim attention  among which the improvement of our country by roads and canals  proceeding always with a constitutional sanction  holds a distinguished place  by thus facilitating the intercourse between the states we shall add much to the convenience and comfort of our fellow citizens  much to the ornament of the country  and  what is of greater importance  we shall shorten distances  and  by making each part more accessible to and dependent on the other  we shall bind the union more closely together  nature has done so much for us by intersecting the country with so many great rivers  bays  and lakes  approaching from distant points so near to each other  that the inducement to complete the work seems to be peculiarly strong  a more interesting spectacle was perhaps never seen than is exhibited within the limits of the united states    a territory so vast and advantageously situated  containing objects so grand  so useful  so happily connected in all their parts   our manufacturers will likewise require the systematic and fostering care of the government  possessing as we do all the raw materials  the fruit of our own soil and industry  we ought not to depend in the degree we have done on supplies from other countries  while we are thus dependent the sudden event of war  unsought and unexpected  can not fail to plunge us into the most serious difficulties it is important  too  that the capital which nourishes our manufacturers should be domestic  as its influence in that case instead of exhausting  as it may do in foreign hands  would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry equally important is it to provide at home a market for our raw materials  as by extending the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualties incident to foreign markets   with the indian tribes it is our duty to cultivate friendly relations and to act with kindness and liberality in all our transactions  equally proper is it to persevere in our efforts to extend to them the advantages of civilization   the great amount of our revenue and the flourishing state of the treasury are a full proof of the competency of the national resources for any emergency  as they are of the willingness of our fellow citizens to bear the burdens which the public necessities require  the vast amount of vacant lands  the value of which daily augments  forms an additional resource of great extent and duration  these resources  besides accomplishing every other necessary purpose  put it completely in the power of the united states to discharge the national debt at an early period  peace is the best time for improvement and preparation of every kind  it is in peace that our commerce flourishes most  that taxes are most easily paid  and that the revenue is most productive   the executive is charged officially in the departments under it with the disbursement of the public money  and is responsible for the faithful application of it to the purposes for which it is raised  the legislature is the watchful guardian over the public purse  it is its duty to see that the disbursement has been honestly made  to meet the requisite responsibility every facility should be afforded to the executive to enable it to bring the public agents intrusted with the public money strictly and promptly to account  nothing should be presumed against them  but if  with the requisite facilities  the public money is suffered to lie long and uselessly in their hands  they will not be the only defaulters  nor will the demoralizing effect be confined to them  it will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the administration which will be felt by the whole community  i shall do all i can to secure economy and fidelity in this important branch of the administration  and i doubt not that the legislature will perform its duty with equal zeal  a thorough examination should be regularly made  and i will promote it   it is particularly gratifying to me to enter on the discharge of these duties at a time when the united states are blessed with peace  it is a state most consistent with their prosperity and happiness  it will be my sincere desire to preserve it  so far as depends on the executive  on just principles with all nations  claiming nothing unreasonable of any and rendering to each what is its due   equally gratifying is it to witness the increased harmony of opinion which pervades our union  discord does not belong to our system  union is recommended as well by the free and benign principles of our government  extending its blessings to every individual  as by the other eminent advantages attending it  the american people have encountered together great dangers and sustained severe trials with success  they constitute one great family with a common interest  experience has enlightened us on some questions of essential importance to the country  the progress has been slow  dictated by a just reflection and a faithful regard to every interest connected with it  to promote this harmony in accord with the principles of our republican government and in a manner to give them the most complete effect  and to advance in all other respects the best interests of our union  will be the object of my constant and zealous exertions   never did a government commence under auspices so favorable  nor ever was success so complete  if we look to the history of other nations  ancient or modern  we find no example of a growth so rapid  so gigantic  of a people so prosperous and happy  in contemplating what we have still to perform  the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he reflects how near our government has approached to perfection  that in respect to it we have no essential improvement to make  that the great object is to preserve it in the essential principles and features which characterize it  and that is to be done by preserving the virtue and enlightening the minds of the people  and as a security against foreign dangers to adopt such arrangements as are indispensable to the support of our independence  our rights and liberties  if we persevere in the career in which we have advanced so far and in the path already traced  we can not fail  under the favor of a gracious providence  to attain the high destiny which seems to await us   in the administrations of the illustrious men who have preceded me in this high station  with some of whom i have been connected by the closest ties from early life  examples are presented which will always be found highly instructive and useful to their successors  from these i shall endeavor to derive all the advantages which they may afford  of my immediate predecessor  under whom so important a portion of this great and successful experiment has been made  i shall be pardoned for expressing my earnest wishes that he may long enjoy in his retirement the affections of a grateful country  the best reward of exalted talents and the most faithful and meritorious service  relying on the aid to be derived from the other departments of the government  i enter on the trust to which i have been called by the suffrages of my fellow citizens with my fervent prayers to the almighty that he will be graciously pleased to continue to us that protection which he has already so conspicuously displayed in our favor  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  i shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotions which the new and very distinguished proof of the confidence of my fellow citizens  evinced by my reelection to this high trust  has excited in my bosom  the approbation which it announces of my conduct in the preceding term affords me a consolation which i shall profoundly feel through life  the general accord with which it has been expressed adds to the great and never ceasing obligations which it imposes  to merit the continuance of this good opinion  and to carry it with me into my retirement as the solace of advancing years  will be the object of my most zealous and unceasing efforts   having no pretensions to the high and commanding claims of my predecessors  whose names are so much more conspicuously identified with our revolution  and who contributed so preeminently to promote its success  i consider myself rather as the instrument than the cause of the union which has prevailed in the late election in surmounting  in favor of my humble pretensions  the difficulties which so often produce division in like occurrences  it is obvious that other powerful causes  indicating the great strength and stability of our union  have essentially contributed to draw you together  that these powerful causes exist  and that they are permanent  is my fixed opinion  that they may produce a like accord in all questions touching  however remotely  the liberty  prosperity and happiness of our country will always be the object of my most fervent prayers to the supreme author of all good   in a government which is founded by the people  who possess exclusively the sovereignty  it seems proper that the person who may be placed by their suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its duties the principles on which he intends to conduct the administration  if the person thus elected has served the preceding term  an opportunity is afforded him to review its principal occurrences and to give such further explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful to his constituents  the events of one year have influence on those of another  and  in like manner  of a preceding on the succeeding administration  the movements of a great nation are connected in all their parts  if errors have been committed they ought to be corrected  if the policy is sound it ought to be supported  it is by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that our fellow citizens are enabled to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future   just before the commencement of the last term the united states had concluded a war with a very powerful nation on conditions equal and honorable to both parties  the events of that war are too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from me  our commerce had been in a great measure driven from the sea  our atlantic and inland frontiers were invaded in almost every part  the waste of life along our coast and on some parts of our inland frontiers  to the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizens were called  was immense  in addition to which not less than  120 000 000 were added at its end to the public debt   as soon as the war had terminated  the nation  admonished by its events  resolved to place itself in a situation which should be better calculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil  and  in case it should recur  to mitigate its calamities  with this view  after reducing our land force to the basis of a peace establishment  which has been further modified since  provision was made for the construction of fortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted to both purposes  the laws making this provision were passed in 1815 and 1816  and it has been since the constant effort of the executive to carry them into effect   the advantage of these fortifications and of an augmented naval force in the extent contemplated  in a point of economy  has been fully illustrated by a report of the board of engineers and naval commissioners lately communicated to congress  by which it appears that in an invasion by 20 000 men  with a correspondent naval force  in a campaign of six months only  the whole expense of the construction of the works would be defrayed by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the aid of those works and that which would be incurred without them  the reason of this difference is obvious  if fortifications are judiciously placed on our great inlets  as distant from our cities as circumstances will permit  they will form the only points of attack  and the enemy will be detained there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable our militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made  a force adequate to the enemy  collected at that single point  with suitable preparation for such others as might be menaced  is all that would be requisite  but if there were no fortifications  then the enemy might go where he pleased  and  changing his position and sailing from place to place  our force must be called out and spread in vast numbers along the whole coast and on both sides of every bay and river as high up in each as it might be navigable for ships of war  by these fortifications  supported by our navy  to which they would afford like support  we should present to other powers an armed front from st  croix to the sabine  which would protect in the event of war our whole coast and interior from invasion  and even in the wars of other powers  in which we were neutral  they would be found eminently useful  as  by keeping their public ships at a distance from our cities  peace and order in them would be preserved and the government be protected from insult   it need scarcely be remarked that these measures have not been resorted to in a spirit of hostility to other powers  such a disposition does not exist toward any power  peace and good will have been  and will hereafter be  cultivated with all  and by the most faithful regard to justice  they have been dictated by a love of peace  of economy  and an earnest desire to save the lives of our fellow citizens from that destruction and our country from that devastation which are inseparable from war when it finds us unprepared for it  it is believed  and experience has shown  that such a preparation is the best expedient that can be resorted to prevent war  i add with much pleasure that considerable progress has already been made in these measures of defense  and that they will be completed in a few years  considering the great extent and importance of the object  if the plan be zealously and steadily persevered in   the conduct of the government in what relates to foreign powers is always an object of the highest importance to the nation  its agriculture  commerce  manufactures  fisheries  revenue  in short  its peace  may all be affected by it  attention is therefore due to this subject   at the period adverted to the powers of europe  after having been engaged in long and destructive wars with each other  had concluded a peace  which happily still exists  our peace with the power with whom we had been engaged had also been concluded  the war between spain and the colonies in south america  which had commenced many years before  was then the only conflict that remained unsettled  this being a contest between different parts of the same community  in which other powers had not interfered  was not affected by their accommodations   this contest was considered at an early stage by my predecessor a civil war in which the parties were entitled to equal rights in our ports  this decision  the first made by any power  being formed on great consideration of the comparative strength and resources of the parties  the length of time  and successful opposition made by the colonies  and of all other circumstances on which it ought to depend  was in strict accord with the law of nations  congress has invariably acted on this principle  having made no change in our relations with either party  our attitude has therefore been that of neutrality between them  which has been maintained by the government with the strictest impartiality  no aid has been afforded to either  nor has any privilege been enjoyed by the one which has not been equally open to the other party  and every exertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the laws prohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both   by this equality between the parties their public vessels have been received in our ports on the same footing  they have enjoyed an equal right to purchase and export arms  munitions of war  and every other supply  the exportation of all articles whatever being permitted under laws which were passed long before the commencement of the contest  our citizens have traded equally with both  and their commerce with each has been alike protected by the government   respecting the attitude which it may be proper for the united states to maintain hereafter between the parties  i have no hesitation in stating it as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observed should still be adhered to  from the change in the government of spain and the negotiation now depending  invited by the cortes and accepted by the colonies  it may be presumed  that their differences will be settled on the terms proposed by the colonies  should the war be continued  the united states  regarding its occurrences  will always have it in their power to adopt such measures respecting it as their honor and interest may require   shortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a system of buccaneering in the neighboring seas  to the great annoyance of the commerce of the united states  and  as was represented  of that of other powers  of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the united states strong proofs were afforded by the establishment at amelia island  and the purposes to which it was made instrumental by this band in 1817  and by the occurrences which took place in other parts of florida in 1818  the details of which in both instances are too well known to require to be now recited  i am satisfied had a less decisive course been adopted that the worst consequences would have resulted from it  we have seen that these checks  decisive as they were  were not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit  many culprits brought within our limits have been condemned to suffer death  the punishment due to that atrocious crime  the decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals fall equally on all whose crimes subject them  by a fair interpretation of the law  to its censure  it belongs to the executive not to suffer the executions under these decisions to transcend the great purpose for which punishment is necessary  the full benefit of example being secured  policy as well as humanity equally forbids that they should be carried further  i have acted on this principle  pardoning those who appear to have been led astray by ignorance of the criminality of the acts they had committed  and suffering the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuating circumstances could be urged   great confidence is entertained that the late treaty with spain  which has been ratified by both the parties  and the ratifications whereof have been exchanged  has placed the relations of the two countries on a basis of permanent friendship  the provision made by it for such of our citizens as have claims on spain of the character described will  it is presumed  be very satisfactory to them  and the boundary which is established between the territories of the parties westward of the mississippi  heretofore in dispute  has  it is thought  been settled on conditions just and advantageous to both  but to the acquisition of florida too much importance can not be attached  it secures to the united states a territory important in itself  and whose importance is much increased by its bearing on many of the highest interests of the union  it opens to several of the neighboring states a free passage to the ocean  through the province ceded  by several rivers  having their sources high up within their limits  it secures us against all future annoyance from powerful indian tribes  it gives us several excellent harbors in the gulf of mexico for ships of war of the largest size  it covers by its position in the gulf the mississippi and other great waters within our extended limits  and thereby enables the united states to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable productions of our whole western country  which find a market through those streams   by a treaty with the british government  bearing date on the 20th of october  1818  the convention regulating the commerce between the united states and great britain  concluded on the 3d of july  1815  which was about expiring  was revived and continued for the term of ten years from the time of its expiration  by that treaty  also  the differences which had arisen under the treaty of ghent respecting the right claimed by the united states for their citizens to take and cure fish on the coast of his britannic majesty s dominions in america  with other differences on important interests  were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties  no agreement has yet been entered into respecting the commerce between the united states and the british dominions in the west indies and on this continent  the restraints imposed on that commerce by great britain  and reciprocated by the united states on a principle of defense  continue still in force   the negotiation with france for the regulation of the commercial relations between the two countries  which in the course of the last summer had been commenced at paris  has since been transferred to this city  and will be pursued on the part of the united states in the spirit of conciliation  and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an arrangement satisfactory to both parties   our relations with the barbary powers are preserved in the same state and by the same means that were employed when i came into this office  as early as 1801 it was found necessary to send a squadron into the mediterranean for the protection of our commerce and no period has intervened  a short term excepted  when it was thought advisable to withdraw it  the great interests which the united states have in the pacific  in commerce and in the fisheries  have also made it necessary to maintain a naval force there in disposing of this force in both instances the most effectual measures in our power have been taken  without interfering with its other duties  for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighboring seas   the situation of the united states in regard to their resources  the extent of their revenue  and the facility with which it is raised affords a most gratifying spectacle  the payment of nearly  67 000 000 of the public debt  with the great progress made in measures of defense and in other improvements of various kinds since the late war  are conclusive proofs of this extraordinary prosperity  especially when it is recollected that these expenditures have been defrayed without a burthen on the people  the direct tax and excise having been repealed soon after the conclusion of the late war  and the revenue applied to these great objects having been raised in a manner not to be felt  our great resources therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interests of the nation  for all such purposes they are inexhaustible  they are more especially to be found in the virtue  patriotism  and intelligence of our fellow citizens  and in the devotion with which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their property in support of the rights and honor of their country   under the present depression of prices  affecting all the productions of the country and every branch of industry  proceeding from causes explained on a former occasion  the revenue has considerably diminished  the effect of which has been to compel congress either to abandon these great measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to supply the deficiency  on the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arising from it would be temporary  loans were authorized for the demands of the last and present year  anxious to relieve my fellow citizens in 1817 from every burthen which could be dispensed with and the state of the treasury permitting it  i recommended the repeal of the internal taxes  knowing that such relief was then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertions made in the late war  i made that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigencies require a recurrence to them at any time while i remained in this trust  i would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on me  by the experiment now making it will be seen by the next session of congress whether the revenue shall have been so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purposes  should the deficiency still continue  and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent  the course to be pursued appears to me to be obvious  i am satisfied that under certain circumstances loans may be resorted to with great advantage  i am equally well satisfied  as a general rule  that the demands of the current year  especially in time of peace  should be provided for by the revenue of that year   i have never dreaded  nor have i ever shunned  in any situation in which i have been placed making appeals to the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizens  well knowing that they could never be made in vain  especially in times of great emergency or for purposes of high national importance  independently of the exigency of the case  many considerations of great weight urge a policy having in view a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demands of the nation  without relying altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce  i am satisfied that internal duties and excises  with corresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind  would  without imposing any serious burdens on the people  enhance the price of produce  promote our manufactures  and augment the revenue  at the same time that they made it more secure and permanent   the care of the indian tribes within our limits has long been an essential part of our system  but  unfortunately  it has not been executed in a manner to accomplish all the objects intended by it  we have treated them as independent nations  without their having any substantial pretensions to that rank  the distinction has flattered their pride  retarded their improvement  and in many instances paved the way to their destruction  the progress of our settlements westward  supported as they are by a dense population  has constantly driven them back  with almost the total sacrifice of the lands which they have been compelled to abandon  they have claims on the magnanimity and  i may add  on the justice of this nation which we must all feel  we should become their real benefactors  we should perform the office of their great father  the endearing title which they emphatically give to the chief magistrate of our union  their sovereignty over vast territories should cease  in lieu of which the right of soil should be secured to each individual and his posterity in competent portions  and for the territory thus ceded by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be granted  to be vested in permanent funds for the support of civil government over them and for the education of their children  for their instruction in the arts of husbandry  and to provide sustenance for them until they could provide it for themselves  my earnest hope is that congress will digest some plan  founded on these principles  with such improvements as their wisdom may suggest  and carry it into effect as soon as it may be practicable   europe is again unsettled and the prospect of war increasing  should the flame light up in any quarter  how far it may extend it is impossible to foresee  it is our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the causes which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere  with every power we are in perfect amity  and it is our interest to remain so if it be practicable on just conditions  i see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power  unless it proceed from a violation of our maritime rights  in these contests  should they occur  and to whatever extent they may be carried  we shall be neutral  but as a neutral power we have rights which it is our duty to maintain  for like injuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit of amity  in full confidence that  injuring none  none would knowingly injure us  for more imminent dangers we should be prepared  and it should always be recollected that such preparation adapted to the circumstances and sanctioned by the judgment and wishes of our constituents can not fail to have a good effect in averting dangers of every kind  we should recollect also that the season of peace is best adapted to these preparations   if we turn our attention  fellow citizens  more immediately to the internal concerns of our country  and more especially to those on which its future welfare depends  we have every reason to anticipate the happiest results  it is now rather more than forty four years since we declared our independence  and thirty seven since it was acknowledged  the talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were a sure presage of all that has since followed  a people who were able to surmount in their infant state such great perils would be more competent as they rose into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their progress  their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign danger  and the practice of self government  aided by the light of experience  could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on all those questions connected with the internal organization  these favorable anticipations have been realized   in our whole system  national and state  we have shunned all the defects which unceasingly preyed on the vitals and destroyed the ancient republics  in them there were distinct orders  a nobility and a people  or the people governed in one assembly  thus  in the one instance there was a perpetual conflict between the orders in society for the ascendency  in which the victory of either terminated in the overthrow of the government and the ruin of the state  in the other  in which the people governed in a body  and whose dominions seldom exceeded the dimensions of a county in one of our states  a tumultuous and disorderly movement permitted only a transitory existence  in this great nation there is but one order  that of the people  whose power  by a peculiarly happy improvement of the representative principle  is transferred from them  without impairing in the slightest degree their sovereignty  to bodies of their own creation  and to persons elected by themselves  in the full extent necessary for all the purposes of free  enlightened and efficient government  the whole system is elective  the complete sovereignty being in the people  and every officer in every department deriving his authority from and being responsible to them for his conduct   our career has corresponded with this great outline  perfection in our organization could not have been expected in the outset either in the national or state governments or in tracing the line between their respective powers  but no serious conflict has arisen  nor any contest but such as are managed by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people  and many of the defects which experience had clearly demonstrated in both governments have been remedied  by steadily pursuing this course in this spirit there is every reason to believe that our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of which human institutions are capable  and that the movement in all its branches will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command the admiration and respect of the civilized world   our physical attainments have not been less eminent  twenty five years ago the river mississippi was shut up and our western brethren had no outlet for their commerce  what has been the progress since that time  the river has not only become the property of the united states from its source to the ocean  with all its tributary streams  with the exception of the upper part of the red river only   but louisiana  with a fair and liberal boundary on the western side and the floridas on the eastern  have been ceded to us  the united states now enjoy the complete and uninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from st  croix to the sabine  new states  settled from among ourselves in this and in other parts  have been admitted into our union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with the original states  our population has augmented in an astonishing degree and extended in every direction  we now  fellow citizens  comprise within our limits the dimensions and faculties of a great power under a government possessing all the energies of any government ever known to the old world  with an utter incapacity to oppress the people   entering with these views the office which i have just solemnly sworn to execute with fidelity and to the utmost of my ability  i derive great satisfaction from a knowledge that i shall be assisted in the several departments by the very enlightened and upright citizens from whom i have received so much aid in the preceding term  with full confidence in the continuance of that candor and generous indulgence from my fellow citizens at large which i have heretofore experienced  and with a firm reliance on the protection of almighty god  i shall forthwith commence the duties of the high trust to which you have called me  ',\n",
       " 'in compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our federal constitution  and sanctioned by the example of my predecessors in the career upon which i am about to enter  i appear  my fellow citizens  in your presence and in that of heaven to bind myself by the solemnities of religious obligation to the faithful performance of the duties allotted to me in the station to which i have been called   in unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which i shall be governed in the fulfillment of those duties my first resort will be to that constitution which i shall swear to the best of my ability to preserve  protect  and defend  that revered instrument enumerates the powers and prescribes the duties of the executive magistrate  and in its first words declares the purposes to which these and the whole action of the government instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly devoted    to form a more perfect union  establish justice  insure domestic tranquillity  provide for the common defense  promote the general welfare  and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of this union in their successive generations  since the adoption of this social compact one of these generations has passed away  it is the work of our forefathers  administered by some of the most eminent men who contributed to its formation  through a most eventful period in the annals of the world  and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war incidental to the condition of associated man  it has not disappointed the hopes and aspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age and nation  it has promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all  it has to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity secured the freedom and happiness of this people  we now receive it as a precious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its establishment  doubly bound by the examples which they have left us and by the blessings which we have enjoyed as the fruits of their labors to transmit the same unimpaired to the succeeding generation   in the compass of thirty six years since this great national covenant was instituted a body of laws enacted under its authority and in conformity with its provisions has unfolded its powers and carried into practical operation its effective energies  subordinate departments have distributed the executive functions in their various relations to foreign affairs  to the revenue and expenditures  and to the military force of the union by land and sea  a coordinate department of the judiciary has expounded the constitution and the laws  settling in harmonious coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty questions of construction which the imperfection of human language had rendered unavoidable  the year of jubilee since the first formation of our union has just elapsed that of the declaration of our independence is at hand  the consummation of both was effected by this constitution   since that period a population of four millions has multiplied to twelve  a territory bounded by the mississippi has been extended from sea to sea  new states have been admitted to the union in numbers nearly equal to those of the first confederation  treaties of peace  amity  and commerce have been concluded with the principal dominions of the earth  the people of other nations  inhabitants of regions acquired not by conquest  but by compact  have been united with us in the participation of our rights and duties  of our burdens and blessings  the forest has fallen by the ax of our woodsmen  the soil has been made to teem by the tillage of our farmers  our commerce has whitened every ocean  the dominion of man over physical nature has been extended by the invention of our artists  liberty and law have marched hand in hand  all the purposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively as under any other government on the globe  and at a cost little exceeding in a whole generation the expenditure of other nations in a single year   such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a constitution founded upon the republican principle of equal rights  to admit that this picture has its shades is but to say that it is still the condition of men upon earth  from evil    physical  moral  and political    it is not our claim to be exempt  we have suffered sometimes by the visitation of heaven through disease  often by the wrongs and injustice of other nations  even to the extremities of war  and  lastly  by dissensions among ourselves    dissensions perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of freedom  but which have more than once appeared to threaten the dissolution of the union  and with it the overthrow of all the enjoyments of our present lot and all our earthly hopes of the future  the causes of these dissensions have been various  founded upon differences of speculation in the theory of republican government  upon conflicting views of policy in our relations with foreign nations  upon jealousies of partial and sectional interests  aggravated by prejudices and prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to entertain   it is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights has at the close of that generation by which it was formed been crowned with success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders  union  justice  tranquillity  the common defense  the general welfare  and the blessings of liberty    all have been promoted by the government under which we have lived  standing at this point of time  looking back to that generation which has gone by and forward to that which is advancing  we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheering hope  from the experience of the past we derive instructive lessons for the future  of the two great political parties which have divided the opinions and feelings of our country  the candid and the just will now admit that both have contributed splendid talents  spotless integrity  ardent patriotism  and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and administration of this government  and that both have required a liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error  the revolutionary wars of europe  commencing precisely at the moment when the government of the united states first went into operation under this constitution  excited a collision of sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all the passions and imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was involved in war and the union was shaken to its center  this time of trial embraced a period of five and twenty years  during which the policy of the union in its relations with europe constituted the principal basis of our political divisions and the most arduous part of the action of our federal government  with the catastrophe in which the wars of the french revolution terminated  and our own subsequent peace with great britain  this baneful weed of party strife was uprooted  from that time no difference of principle  connected either with the theory of government or with our intercourse with foreign nations  has existed or been called forth in force sufficient to sustain a continued combination of parties or to give more than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate  our political creed is  without a dissenting voice that can be heard  that the will of the people is the source and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate government upon earth  that the best security for the beneficence and the best guaranty against the abuse of power consists in the freedom  the purity  and the frequency of popular elections  that the general government of the union and the separate governments of the states are all sovereignties of limited powers  fellow servants of the same masters  uncontrolled within their respective spheres  uncontrollable by encroachments upon each other  that the firmest security of peace is the preparation during peace of the defenses of war  that a rigorous economy and accountability of public expenditures should guard against the aggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation  that the military should be kept in strict subordination to the civil power  that the freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate  that the policy of our country is peace and the ark of our salvation union are articles of faith upon which we are all now agreed  if there have been those who doubted whether a confederated representative democracy were a government competent to the wise and orderly management of the common concerns of a mighty nation  those doubts have been dispelled  if there have been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the ruins of the union  they have been scattered to the winds  if there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation and antipathies against another  they have been extinguished  ten years of peace  at home and abroad  have assuaged the animosities of political contention and blended into harmony the most discordant elements of public opinion there still remains one effort of magnanimity  one sacrifice of prejudice and passion  to be made by the individuals throughout the nation who have heretofore followed the standards of political party  it is that of discarding every remnant of rancor against each other  of embracing as countrymen and friends  and of yielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence which in times of contention for principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge of party communion   the collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative opinions or in different views of administrative policy are in their nature transitory  those which are founded on geographical divisions  adverse interests of soil  climate  and modes of domestic life are more permanent  and therefore  perhaps  more dangerous  it is this which gives inestimable value to the character of our government  at once federal and national  it holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each individual state in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that of the union  whatsoever is of domestic concernment  unconnected with the other members of the union or with foreign lands  belongs exclusively to the administration of the state governments  whatsoever directly involves the rights and interests of the federative fraternity or of foreign powers is of the resort of this general government  the duties of both are obvious in the general principle  though sometimes perplexed with difficulties in the detail  to respect the rights of the state governments is the inviolable duty of that of the union  the government of every state will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the whole  the prejudices everywhere too commonly entertained against distant strangers are worn away  and the jealousies of jarring interests are allayed by the composition and functions of the great national councils annually assembled from all quarters of the union at this place  here the distinguished men from every section of our country  while meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of those by whom they are deputed  learn to estimate the talents and do justice to the virtues of each other  the harmony of the nation is promoted and the whole union is knit together by the sentiments of mutual respect  the habits of social intercourse  and the ties of personal friendship formed between the representatives of its several parts in the performance of their service at this metropolis   passing from this general review of the purposes and injunctions of the federal constitution and their results as indicating the first traces of the path of duty in the discharge of my public trust  i turn to the administration of my immediate predecessor as the second  it has passed away in a period of profound peace  how much to the satisfaction of our country and to the honor of our country s name is known to you all  the great features of its policy  in general concurrence with the will of the legislature  have been to cherish peace while preparing for defensive war  to yield exact justice to other nations and maintain the rights of our own  to cherish the principles of freedom and of equal rights wherever they were proclaimed  to discharge with all possible promptitude the national debt  to reduce within the narrowest limits of efficiency the military force  to improve the organization and discipline of the army  to provide and sustain a school of military science  to extend equal protection to all the great interests of the nation  to promote the civilization of the indian tribes  and to proceed in the great system of internal improvements within the limits of the constitutional power of the union  under the pledge of these promises  made by that eminent citizen at the time of his first induction to this office  in his career of eight years the internal taxes have been repealed  sixty millions of the public debt have been discharged  provision has been made for the comfort and relief of the aged and indigent among the surviving warriors of the revolution  the regular armed force has been reduced and its constitution revised and perfected  the accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has bee made more effective  the floridas have been peaceably acquired  and our boundary has been extended to the pacific ocean  the independence of the southern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized  and recommended by example and by counsel to the potentates of europe  progress has been made in the defense of the country by fortifications and the increase of the navy  toward the effectual suppression of the african traffic in slaves  in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the cultivation of the soil and of the mind  in exploring the interior regions of the union  and in preparing by scientific researches and surveys for the further application of our national resources to the internal improvement of our country   in this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate predecessor the line of duty for his successor is clearly delineated to pursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our common condition instituted or recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere of my obligations  to the topic of internal improvement  emphatically urged by him at his inauguration  i recur with peculiar satisfaction  it is that from which i am convinced that the unborn millions of our posterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the union  that in which the beneficent action of its government will be most deeply felt and acknowledged  the magnificence and splendor of their public works are among the imperishable glories of the ancient republics  the roads and aqueducts of rome have been the admiration of all afte ages  and have survived thousands of years after all her conquests have been swallowed up in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians  some diversity of opinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of congress for legislation upon objects of this nature  the most respectful deference is due to doubts originating in pure patriotism and sustained by venerated authority  but nearly twenty years have passed since the construction of the first national road was commenced  the authority for its construction was then unquestioned  to how many thousands of our countrymen has it proved a benefit  to what single individual has it ever proved an injury  repeated  liberal  and candid discussions in the legislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated the opinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power  i can not but hope that by the same process of friendly  patient  and persevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed  the extent and limitation of the powers of the general government in relation to this transcendently important interest will be settled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all  and every speculative scruple will be solved by a practical public blessing   fellow citizens  you are acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of the recent election  which have resulted in affording me the opportunity of addressing you at this time  you have heard the exposition of the principles which will direct me in the fulfillment of the high and solemn trust imposed upon me in this station  less possessed of your confidence in advance than any of my predecessors  i am deeply conscious of the prospect that i shall stand more and oftener in need of your indulgence  intentions upright and pure  a heart devoted to the welfare of our country  and the unceasing application of all the faculties allotted to me to her service are all the pledges that i can give for the faithful performance of the arduous duties i am to undertake  to the guidance of the legislative councils  to the assistance of the executive and subordinate departments  to the friendly cooperation of the respective state governments  to the candid and liberal support of the people so far as it may be deserved by honest industry and zeal  i shall look for whatever success may attend my public service  and knowing that  except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain   with fervent supplications for his favor  to his overruling providence i commit with humble but fearless confidence my own fate and the future destinies of my country     ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  about to undertake the arduous duties that i have been appointed to perform by the choice of a free people  i avail myself of this customary and solemn occasion to express the gratitude which their confidence inspires and to acknowledge the accountability which my situation enjoins  while the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred  it admonishes me that the best return i can make is the zealous dedication of my humble abilities to their service and their good   as the instrument of the federal constitution it will devolve on me for a stated period to execute the laws of the united states  to superintend their foreign and their confederate relations  to manage their revenue  to command their forces  and  by communications to the legislature  to watch over and to promote their interests generally  and the principles of action by which i shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duties it is now proper for me briefly to explain   in administering the laws of congress i shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the executive power trusting thereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its authority  with foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms  and in the adjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belonging to a gallant people   in such measures as i may be called on to pursue in regard to the rights of the separate states i hope to be animated by a proper respect for those sovereign members of our union  taking care not to confound the powers they have reserved to themselves with those they have granted to the confederacy   the management of the public revenue    that searching operation in all governments    is among the most delicate and important trusts in ours  and it will  of course  demand no inconsiderable share of my official solicitude  under every aspect in which it can be considered it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and faithful economy  this i shall aim at the more anxiously both because it will facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt  the unnecessary duration of which is incompatible with real independence  and because it will counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a profuse expenditure of money by the government is but too apt to engender  powerful auxiliaries to the attainment of this desirable end are to be found in the regulations provided by the wisdom of congress for the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt accountability of public officers   with regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view to revenue  it would seem to me that the spirit of equity  caution and compromise in which the constitution was formed requires that the great interests of agriculture  commerce  and manufactures should be equally favored  and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may be found essential to our national independence   internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge  so far as they can be promoted by the constitutional acts of the federal government  are of high importance   considering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of peace  i shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment  nor disregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teaches that the military should be held subordinate to the civil power  the gradual increase of our navy  whose flag has displayed in distant climes our skill in navigation and our fame in arms  the preservation of our forts  arsenals  and dockyards  and the introduction of progressive improvements in the discipline and science of both branches of our military service are so plainly prescribed by prudence that i should be excused for omitting their mention sooner than for enlarging on their importance  but the bulwark of our defense is the national militia  which in the present state of our intelligence and population must render us invincible  as long as our government is administered for the good of the people  and is regulated by their will  as long as it secures to us the rights of person and of property  liberty of conscience and of the press  it will be worth defending  and so long as it is worth defending a patriotic militia will cover it with an impenetrable aegis  partial injuries and occasional mortifications we may be subjected to  but a million of armed freemen  possessed of the means of war  can never be conquered by a foreign foe  to any just system  therefore  calculated to strengthen this natural safeguard of the country i shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power   it will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the indian tribes within our limits a just and liberal policy  and to give that humane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our government and the feelings of our people   the recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of executive duties  in characters too legible to be overlooked  the task of reform  which will require particularly the correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage of the federal government into conflict with the freedom of elections  and the counteraction of those causes which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have placed or continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands   in the performance of a task thus generally delineated i shall endeavor to select men whose diligence and talents will insure in their respective stations able and faithful cooperation  depending for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the public officers than on their numbers   a diffidence  perhaps too just  in my own qualifications will teach me to look with reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my illustrious predecessors  and with veneration to the lights that flow from the mind that founded and the mind that reformed our system  the same diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the coordinate branches of the government  and for the indulgence and support of my fellow citizens generally  and a firm reliance on the goodness of that power whose providence mercifully protected our national infancy  and has since upheld our liberties in various vicissitudes  encourages me to offer up my ardent supplications that he will continue to make our beloved country the object of his divine care and gracious benediction  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  the will of the american people  expressed through their unsolicited suffrages  calls me before you to pass through the solemnities preparatory to taking upon myself the duties of president of the united states for another term  for their approbation of my public conduct through a period which has not been without its difficulties  and for this renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions  i am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude  it shall be displayed to the extent of my humble abilities in continued efforts so to administer the government as to preserve their liberty and promote their happiness   so many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called forth    sometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painful    my views of the principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the general government that i need on this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them   the foreign policy adopted by our government soon after the formation of our present constitution  and very generally pursued by successive administrations  has been crowned with almost complete success  and has elevated our character among the nations of the earth  to do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none has been during my administration its governing maxim  and so happy have been its results that we are not only at peace with all the world  but have few causes of controversy  and those of minor importance  remaining unadjusted   in the domestic policy of this government there are two objects which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representatives  and which have been and will continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude  they are the preservation of the rights of the several states and the integrity of the union   these great objects are necessarily connected  and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed  to this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several states and of the united states which the people themselves have ordained for their own government   my experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me  that the destruction of our state governments or the annihilation of their control over the local concerns of the people would lead directly to revolution and anarchy  and finally to despotism and military domination  in proportion  therefore  as the general government encroaches upon the rights of the states  in the same proportion does it impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the purposes of its creation  solemnly impressed with these considerations  my countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional powers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the rights of the states or tend to consolidate all political power in the general government  but of equal and  indeed  of incalculable  importance is the union of these states  and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the general government in the exercise of its just powers  you have been wisely admonished to  accustom yourselves to think and speak of the union as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity  watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety  discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned  and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts   without union our independence and liberty would never have been achieved  without union they never can be maintained  divided into twenty four  or even a smaller number  of separate communities  we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints and exactions  communication between distant points and sections obstructed or cut off  our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now till in peace  the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies  and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming our lawgivers and judges  the loss of liberty  of all good government  of peace  plenty  and happiness  must inevitably follow a dissolution of the union  in supporting it  therefore  we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist  the time at which i stand before you is full of interest  the eyes of all nations are fixed on our republic  the event of the existing crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government  great is the stake placed in our hands  great is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the united states  let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world  let us exercise forbearance and firmness  let us extricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate   deeply impressed with the truth of these observations  and under the obligation of that solemn oath which i am about to take  i shall continue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the constitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of our federal union  at the same time  it will be my aim to inculcate by my official acts the necessity of exercising by the general government those powers only that are clearly delegated  to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditures of the government  to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these objects  and in a manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the community and of all portions of the union  constantly bearing in mind that in entering into society  individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest   it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise  and  by reconciling our fellow citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a greater good  to recommend our invaluable government and union to the confidence and affections of the american people   finally  it is my most fervent prayer to that almighty being before whom i now stand  and who has kept us in his hands from the infancy of our republic to the present day  that he will so overrule all my intentions and actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow citizens that we may be preserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and happy people  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  the practice of all my predecessors imposes on me an obligation i cheerfully fulfill    to accompany the first and solemn act of my public trust with an avowal of the principles that will guide me in performing it and an expression of my feelings on assuming a charge so responsible and vast  in imitating their example i tread in the footsteps of illustrious men  whose superiors it is our happiness to believe are not found on the executive calendar of any country  among them we recognize the earliest and firmest pillars of the republic    those by whom our national independence was first declared  him who above all others contributed to establish it on the field of battle  and those whose expanded intellect and patriotism constructed  improved  and perfected the inestimable institutions under which we live  if such men in the position i now occupy felt themselves overwhelmed by a sense of gratitude for this the highest of all marks of their country s confidence  and by a consciousness of their inability adequately to discharge the duties of an office so difficult and exalted  how much more must these considerations affect one who can rely on no such claims for favor or forbearance  unlike all who have preceded me  the revolution that gave us existence as one people was achieved at the period of my birth  and whilst i contemplate with grateful reverence that memorable event  i feel that i belong to a later age and that i may not expect my countrymen to weigh my actions with the same kind and partial hand   so sensibly  fellow citizens  do these circumstances press themselves upon me that i should not dare to enter upon my path of duty did i not look for the generous aid of those who will be associated with me in the various and coordinate branches of the government  did i not repose with unwavering reliance on the patriotism  the intelligence  and the kindness of a people who never yet deserted a public servant honestly laboring their cause  and  above all  did i not permit myself humbly to hope for the sustaining support of an ever watchful and beneficent providence   to the confidence and consolation derived from these sources it would be ungrateful not to add those which spring from our present fortunate condition  though not altogether exempt from embarrassments that disturb our tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad  yet in all the attributes of a great  happy  and flourishing people we stand without a parallel in the world  abroad we enjoy the respect and  with scarcely an exception  the friendship of every nation  at home  while our government quietly but efficiently performs the sole legitimate end of political institutions    in doing the greatest good to the greatest number    we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be found   how imperious  then  is the obligation imposed upon every citizen  in his own sphere of action  whether limited or extended  to exert himself in perpetuating a condition of things so singularly happy  all the lessons of history and experience must be lost upon us if we are content to trust alone to the peculiar advantages we happen to possess  position and climate and the bounteous resources that nature has scattered with so liberal a hand    even the diffused intelligence and elevated character of our people    will avail us nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those political institutions that were wisely and deliberately formed with reference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger the blessings we enjoy  the thoughtful framers of our constitution legislated for our country as they found it  looking upon it with the eyes of statesmen and patriots  they saw all the sources of rapid and wonderful prosperity  but they saw also that various habits  opinions and institutions peculiar to the various portions of so vast a region were deeply fixed  distinct sovereignties were in actual existence  whose cordial union was essential to the welfare and happiness of all  between many of them there was  at least to some extent  a real diversity of interests  liable to be exaggerated through sinister designs  they differed in size  in population  in wealth  and in actual and prospective resources and power  they varied in the character of their industry and staple productions  and  in some  existed domestic institutions which  unwisely disturbed  might endanger the harmony of the whole  most carefully were all these circumstances weighed  and the foundations of the new government laid upon principles of reciprocal concession and equitable compromise  the jealousies which the smaller states might entertain of the power of the rest were allayed by a rule of representation confessedly unequal at the time  and designed forever to remain so  a natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation might bear upon and unwisely control particular interests was counteracted by limits strictly drawn around the action of the federal authority  and to the people and the states was left unimpaired their sovereign power over the innumerable subjects embraced in the internal government of a just republic  excepting such only as necessarily appertain to the concerns of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as a united community with the other nations of the world   this provident forecast has been verified by time  half a century  teeming with extraordinary events  and elsewhere producing astonishing results  has passed along  but on our institutions it has left no injurious mark  from a small community we have risen to a people powerful in numbers and in strength  but with our increase has gone hand in hand the progress of just principles  the privileges  civil and religious  of the humblest individual are still sacredly protected at home  and while the valor and fortitude of our people have removed far from us the slightest apprehension of foreign power  they have not yet induced us in a single instance to forget what is right  our commerce has been extended to the remotest nations  the value and even nature of our productions have been greatly changed  a wide difference has arisen in the relative wealth and resources of every portion of our country  yet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to existing compacts has continued to prevail in our councils and never long been absent from our conduct  we have learned by experience a fruitful lesson    that an implicit and undeviating adherence to the principles on which we set out can carry us prosperously onward through all the conflicts of circumstances and vicissitudes inseparable from the lapse of years   the success that has thus attended our great experiment is in itself a sufficient cause for gratitude  on account of the happiness it has actually conferred and the example it has unanswerably given but to me  my fellow citizens  looking forward to the far distant future with ardent prayers and confiding hopes  this retrospect presents a ground for still deeper delight  it impresses on my mind a firm belief that the perpetuity of our institutions depends upon ourselves  that if we maintain the principles on which they were established they are destined to confer their benefits on countless generations yet to come  and that america will present to every friend of mankind the cheering proof that a popular government  wisely formed  is wanting in no element of endurance or strength  fifty years ago its rapid failure was boldly predicted  latent and uncontrollable causes of dissolution were supposed to exist even by the wise and good  and not only did unfriendly or speculative theorists anticipate for us the fate of past republics  but the fears of many an honest patriot overbalanced his sanguine hopes  look back on these forebodings  not hastily but reluctantly made  and see how in every instance they have completely failed   an imperfect experience during the struggles of the revolution was supposed to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the taxation requisite to discharge an immense public debt already incurred and to pay the necessary expenses of the government the cost of two wars has been paid  not only without a murmur  but with unequaled alacrity  no one is now left to doubt that every burden will be cheerfully borne that may be necessary to sustain our civil institutions or guard our honor or welfare  indeed  all experience has shown that the willingness of the people to contribute to these ends in cases of emergency has uniformly outrun the confidence of their representatives   in the early stages of the new government  when all felt the imposing influence as they recognized the unequaled services of the first president  it was a common sentiment that the great weight of his character could alone bind the discordant materials of our government together and save us from the violence of contending factions  since his death nearly forty years are gone  party exasperation has been often carried to its highest point  the virtue and fortitude of the people have sometimes been greatly tried  yet our system  purified and enhanced in value by all it has encountered  still preserves its spirit of free and fearless discussion  blended with unimpaired fraternal feeling   the capacity of the people for self government  and their willingness  from a high sense of duty and without those exhibitions of coercive power so generally employed in other countries  to submit to all needful restraints and exactions of municipal law  have also been favorably exemplified in the history of the american states  occasionally  it is true  the ardor of public sentiment  outrunning the regular progress of the judicial tribunals or seeking to reach cases not denounced as criminal by the existing law  has displayed itself in a manner calculated to give pain to the friends of free government and to encourage the hopes of those who wish for its overthrow  these occurrences  however  have been far less frequent in our country than in any other of equal population on the globe  and with the diffusion of intelligence it may well be hoped that they will constantly diminish in frequency and violence  the generous patriotism and sound common sense of the great mass of our fellow citizens will assuredly in time produce this result  for as every assumption of illegal power not only wounds the majesty of the law  but furnishes a pretext for abridging the liberties of the people  the latter have the most direct and permanent interest in preserving the landmarks of social order and maintaining on all occasions the inviolability of those constitutional and legal provisions which they themselves have made   in a supposed unfitness of our institutions for those hostile emergencies which no country can always avoid their friends found a fruitful source of apprehension  their enemies of hope  while they foresaw less promptness of action than in governments differently formed  they overlooked the far more important consideration that with us war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will  but must be a measure of redress for injuries sustained voluntarily resorted to by those who were to bear the necessary sacrifice  who would consequently feel an individual interest in the contest  and whose energy would be commensurate with the difficulties to be encountered  actual events have proved their error  the last war  far from impairing  gave new confidence to our government  and amid recent apprehensions of a similar conflict we saw that the energies of our country would not be wanting in ample season to vindicate its rights  we may not possess  as we should not desire to possess  the extended and ever ready military organization of other nations  we may occasionally suffer in the outset for the want of it  but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point has ceased  while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion from inviting aggression from abroad   certain danger was foretold from the extension of our territory  the multiplication of states  and the increase of population  our system was supposed to be adapted only to boundaries comparatively narrow  these have been widened beyond conjecture  the members of our confederacy are already doubled  and the numbers of our people are incredibly augmented  the alleged causes of danger have long surpassed anticipation  but none of the consequences have followed  the power and influence of the republic have arisen to a height obvious to all mankind  respect for its authority was not more apparent at its ancient than it is at its present limits  new and inexhaustible sources of general prosperity have been opened  the effects of distance have been averted by the inventive genius of our people  developed and fostered by the spirit of our institutions  and the enlarged variety and amount of interests  productions  and pursuits have strengthened the chain of mutual dependence and formed a circle of mutual benefits too apparent ever to be overlooked   in justly balancing the powers of the federal and state authorities difficulties nearly insurmountable arose at the outset and subsequent collisions were deemed inevitable  amid these it was scarcely believed possible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could remain uninjured  from time to time embarrassments have certainly occurred  but how just is the confidence of future safety imparted by the knowledge that each in succession has been happily removed  overlooking partial and temporary evils as inseparable from the practical operation of all human institutions  and looking only to the general result  every patriot has reason to be satisfied  while the federal government has successfully performed its appropriate functions in relation to foreign affairs and concerns evidently national  that of every state has remarkably improved in protecting and developing local interests and individual welfare  and if the vibrations of authority have occasionally tended too much toward one or the other  it is unquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system has been to strengthen all the existing institutions and to elevate our whole country in prosperity and renown   the last  perhaps the greatest  of the prominent sources of discord and disaster supposed to lurk in our political condition was the institution of domestic slavery  our forefathers were deeply impressed with the delicacy of this subject  and they treated it with a forbearance so evidently wise that in spite of every sinister foreboding it never until the present period disturbed the tranquillity of our common country  such a result is sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism of their course  it is evidence not to be mistaken that an adherence to it can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other anticipated cause of difficulty or danger  have not recent events made it obvious to the slightest reflection that the least deviation from this spirit of forbearance is injurious to every interest  that of humanity included  amidst the violence of excited passions this generous and fraternal feeling has been sometimes disregarded  and standing as i now do before my countrymen  in this high place of honor and of trust  i can not refrain from anxiously invoking my fellow citizens never to be deaf to its dictates  perceiving before my election the deep interest this subject was beginning to excite  i believed it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiments in regard to it  and now  when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away  i trust that they will be candidly weighed and understood  at least they will be my standard of conduct in the path before me  i then declared that if the desire of those of my countrymen who were favorable to my election was gratified  i must go into the presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of congress to abolish slavery in the district of columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding states  and also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest interference with it in the states where it exists   i submitted also to my fellow citizens  with fullness and frankness  the reasons which led me to this determination  the result authorizes me to believe that they have been approved and are confided in by a majority of the people of the united states  including those whom they most immediately affect it now only remains to add that no bill conflicting with these views can ever receive my constitutional sanction  these opinions have been adopted in the firm belief that they are in accordance with the spirit that actuated the venerated fathers of the republic  and that succeeding experience has proved them to be humane  patriotic  expedient  honorable  and just  if the agitation of this subject was intended to reach the stability of our institutions  enough has occurred to show that it has signally failed  and that in this as in every other instance the apprehensions of the timid and the hopes of the wicked for the destruction of our government are again destined to be disappointed  here and there  indeed  scenes of dangerous excitement have occurred  terrifying instances of local violence have been witnessed  and a reckless disregard of the consequences of their conduct has exposed individuals to popular indignation  but neither masses of the people nor sections of the country have been swerved from their devotion to the bond of union and the principles it has made sacred  it will be ever thus  such attempts at dangerous agitation may periodically return  but with each the object will be better understood  that predominating affection for our political system which prevails throughout our territorial limits  that calm and enlightened judgment which ultimately governs our people as one vast body  will always be at hand to resist and control every effort  foreign or domestic  which aims or would lead to overthrow our institutions   what can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this  we look back on obstacles avoided and dangers overcome  on expectations more than realized and prosperity perfectly secured  to the hopes of the hostile  the fears of the timid  and the doubts of the anxious actual experience has given the conclusive reply  we have seen time gradually dispel every unfavorable foreboding and our constitution surmount every adverse circumstance dreaded at the outset as beyond control  present excitement will at all times magnify present dangers  but true philosophy must teach us that none more threatening than the past can remain to be overcome  and we ought  for we have just reason  to entertain an abiding confidence in the stability of our institutions and an entire conviction that if administered in the true form  character  and spirit in which they were established they are abundantly adequate to preserve to us and our children the rich blessings already derived from them  to make our beloved land for a thousand generations that chosen spot where happiness springs from a perfect equality of political rights   for myself  therefore  i desire to declare that the principle that will govern me in the high duty to which my country calls me is a strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution as it was designed by those who framed it  looking back to it as a sacred instrument carefully and not easily framed  remembering that it was throughout a work of concession and compromise  viewing it as limited to national objects  regarding it as leaving to the people and the states all power not explicitly parted with  i shall endeavor to preserve  protect  and defend it by anxiously referring to its provision for direction in every action  to matters of domestic concernment which it has intrusted to the federal government and to such as relate to our intercourse with foreign nations i shall zealously devote myself  beyond those limits i shall never pass   to enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected  before the suffrages of my countrymen were conferred upon me i submitted to them  with great precision  my opinions on all the most prominent of these subjects  those opinions i shall endeavor to carry out with my utmost ability   our course of foreign policy has been so uniform and intelligible as to constitute a rule of executive conduct which leaves little to my discretion  unless  indeed  i were willing to run counter to the lights of experience and the known opinions of my constituents  we sedulously cultivate the friendship of all nations as the conditions most compatible with our welfare and the principles of our government  we decline alliances as adverse to our peace  we desire commercial relations on equal terms  being ever willing to give a fair equivalent for advantages received  we endeavor to conduct our intercourse with openness and sincerity  promptly avowing our objects and seeking to establish that mutual frankness which is as beneficial in the dealings of nations as of men  we have no disposition and we disclaim all right to meddle in disputes  whether internal or foreign  that may molest other countries  regarding them in their actual state as social communities  and preserving a strict neutrality in all their controversies  well knowing the tried valor of our people and our exhaustless resources  we neither anticipate nor fear any designed aggression  and in the consciousness of our own just conduct we feel a security that we shall never be called upon to exert our determination never to permit an invasion of our rights without punishment or redress   in approaching  then  in the presence of my assembled countrymen  to make the solemn promise that yet remains  and to pledge myself that i will faithfully execute the office i am about to fill  i bring with me a settled purpose to maintain the institutions of my country  which i trust will atone for the errors i commit   in receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided to my illustrious predecessor  and which he has discharged so faithfully and so well  i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success  but united as i have been in his counsels  a daily witness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his country s welfare  agreeing with him in sentiments which his countrymen have warmly supported  and permitted to partake largely of his confidence  i may hope that somewhat of the same cheering approbation will be found to attend upon my path  for him i but express with my own the wishes of all  that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his well spent life  and for myself  conscious of but one desire  faithfully to serve my country  i throw myself without fear on its justice and its kindness  beyond that i only look to the gracious protection of the divine being whose strengthening support i humbly solicit  and whom i fervently pray to look down upon us all  may it be among the dispensations of his providence to bless our beloved country with honors and with length of days  may her ways be ways of pleasantness and all her paths be peace  ',\n",
       " 'called from a retirement which i had supposed was to continue for the residue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation  i appear before you  fellow citizens  to take the oaths which the constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification for the performance of its duties  and in obedience to a custom coeval with our government and what i believe to be your expectations i proceed to present to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the discharge of the duties which i shall be called upon to perform   it was the remark of a roman consul in an early period of that celebrated republic that a most striking contrast was observable in the conduct of candidates for offices of power and trust before and after obtaining them  they seldom carrying out in the latter case the pledges and promises made in the former  however much the world may have improved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years since the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant roman  i fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confidence   although the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the chief magistrate of this glorious union  nothing upon their part remaining to be done  it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions  and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those i shall now deliver  or  approving them  to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered  but the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their fears  the outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by an administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable history  and i shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed with the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray  however strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding people  i too well understand the dangerous temptations to which i shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that almighty power which has hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important but still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my country   the broad foundation upon which our constitution rests being the people  a breath of theirs having made  as a breath can unmake  change  or modify it  it can be assigned to none of the great divisions of government but to that of democracy  if such is its theory  those who are called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle the duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number  but with these broad admissions  if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people with the power claimed by other sovereignties  even by those which have been considered most purely democratic  we shall find a most essential difference  all others lay claim to power limited only by their own will  the majority of our citizens  on the contrary  possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has been granted to them by the parties to the national compact  and nothing beyond  we admit of no government by divine right  believing that so far as power is concerned the beneficent creator has made no distinction amongst men  that all are upon an equality  and that the only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed  the constitution of the united states is the instrument containing this grant of power to the several departments composing the government  on an examination of that instrument it will be found to contain declarations of power granted and of power withheld  the latter is also susceptible of division into power which the majority had the right to grant  but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agents  and that which they could not have granted  not being possessed by themselves  in other words  there are certain rights possessed by each individual american citizen which in his compact with the others he has never surrendered  some of them  indeed  he is unable to surrender  being  in the language of our system  unalienable  the boasted privilege of a roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial ruler  whilst the proud democrat of athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith  which no one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of all  or the banishment from his home  his family  and his country with or without an alleged cause  that it was the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy  but of his assembled countrymen  far different is the power of our sovereignty  it can interfere with no one s faith  prescribe forms of worship for no one s observance  inflict no punishment but after well ascertained guilt  the result of investigation under rules prescribed by the constitution itself  these precious privileges  and those scarcely less important of giving expression to his thoughts and opinions  either by writing or speaking  unrestrained but by the liability for injury to others  and that of a full participation in all the advantages which flow from the government  the acknowledged property of all  the american citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellow man  he claims them because he is himself a man  fashioned by the same almighty hand as the rest of his species and entitled to a full share of the blessings with which he has endowed them  notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of the united stages and the restricted grant of power to the government which they have adopted  enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created  it has been found powerful in war  and hitherto justice has been administered  and intimate union effected  domestic tranquillity preserved  and personal liberty secured to the citizen  as was to be expected  however  from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the constitution is written  disputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually granted or was intended to grant   this is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treats of the legislative branch  and not only as regards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving that body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the specified powers  but in relation to the latter also  it is  however  consolatory to reflect that most of the instances of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the constitution have ultimately received the sanction of a majority of the people  and the fact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on both sides of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference that the errors  if errors there were  are attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive  but the great danger to our institutions does not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the government of power not granted by the people  but by the accumulation in one of the departments of that which was assigned to others  limited as are the powers which have been granted  still enough have been granted to constitute a despotism if concentrated in one of the departments  this danger is greatly heightened  as it has been always observable that men are less jealous of encroachments of one department upon another than upon their own reserved rights  when the constitution of the united states first came from the hands of the convention which formed it  many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power which had been granted to the federal government  and more particularly of that portion which had been assigned to the executive branch  there were in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a simple representative democracy or republic  and knowing the tendency of power to increase itself  particularly when exercised by a single individual  predictions were made that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy  it would not become me to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized  but as i sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men s opinions for some years past has been in that direction  it is  i conceive  strictly proper that i should take this occasion to repeat the assurances i have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exists and restore the government to its pristine health and vigor  as far as this can be effected by any legitimate exercise of the power placed in my hands   i proceed to state in as summary a manner as i can my opinion of the sources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and the correctives which may be applied  some of the former are unquestionably to be found in the defects of the constitution  others  in my judgment  are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provisions  of the former is the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the presidency  the sagacious mind of mr  jefferson early saw and lamented this error  and attempts have been made  hitherto without success  to apply the amendatory power of the states to its correction  as  however  one mode of correction is in the power of every president  and consequently in mine  it would be useless  and perhaps invidious  to enumerate the evils of which  in the opinion of many of our fellow citizens  this error of the sages who framed the constitution may have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to gather from it if it continues to disfigure our system  it may be observed  however  as a general remark  that republics can commit no greater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of government which may be calculated to create or increase the lover of power in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit the management of their affairs  and surely nothing is more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust  nothing can be more corrupting  nothing more destructive of all those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot  when this corrupting passion once takes possession of the human mind  like the love of gold it becomes insatiable  it is the never dying worm in his bosom  grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim  if this is true  it is the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations  the execution of her laws  and the command of her armies and navies to a period so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable agent  not the principal  the servant  not the master  until an amendment of the constitution can be effected public opinion may secure the desired object  i give my aid to it by renewing the pledge heretofore given that under no circumstances will i consent to serve a second term   but if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects of the constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the executive power in the same hands  there is  i apprehend  not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers actually given  i can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the president a part of the legislative power  it can not be claimed from the power to recommend  since  although enjoined as a duty upon him  it is a privilege which he holds in common with every other citizen  and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measures recommended in the one case than in the other  in the obligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference  in the language of the constitution   all the legislative powers  which it grants  are vested in the congress of the united states   it would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in the whole   it may be said  indeed  that the constitution has given to the executive the power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent  so a similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary  and yet the judiciary forms no part of the legislature  there is  it is true  this difference between these grants of power  the executive can put his negative upon the acts of the legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the constitution  whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument  but the decision of the judiciary is final in such a case  whereas in every instance where the veto of the executive is applied it may be overcome by a vote of two thirds of both houses of congress  the negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive authority  and that in the hands of one individual  would seem to be an incongruity in our system  like some others of a similar character  however  it appears to be highly expedient  and if used only with the forbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may be productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to the union  at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the state governments  it existed but in two  and in one of these there was a plural executive  if we would search for the motives which operated upon the purely patriotic and enlightened assembly which framed the constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the leading democratic principle that the majority should govern  we must reject the idea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation  they knew too well the high degree of intelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened character of the state legislatures not to have the fullest confidence that the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of such constituents  and  of course  that they would require no aid in conceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the country might require  and it is preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have been entertained that the president  placed at the capital  in the center of the country  could better understand the wants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives  who spend a part of every year among them  living with them  often laboring with them  and bound to them by the triple tie of interest  duty  and affection  to assist or control congress  then  in its ordinary legislation could not  i conceive  have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the president  this argument acquires additional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the first six presidents  and two of them were members of the convention  one presiding over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger share in consummating the labors of that august body than any other person  but if bills were never returned to congress by either of the presidents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient or not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people  the veto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the constitution or because errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment   there is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle  which had probably more influence in recommending it to the convention than any other  i refer to the security which it gives to the just and equitable action of the legislature upon all parts of the union  it could not but have occurred to the convention that in a country so extensive  embracing so great a variety of soil and climate  and consequently of products  and which from the same causes must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various sections  calling for a great diversity in the employments of the people  that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interests of the minority  and that acts of this character might be passed under an express grant by the words of the constitution  and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void  that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the members of congress might be  and however largely partaking  in the general  of the liberal feelings of the people  it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings  it was proper  therefore  to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influences might be expected  such a one was afforded by the executive department constituted by the constitution  a person elected to that high office  having his constituents in every section  state  and subdivision of the union  must consider himself bound by the most solemn sanctions to guard  protect  and defend the rights of all and of every portion  great or small  from the injustice and oppression of the rest  i consider the veto power  therefore given by the constitution to the executive of the united states solely as a conservative power  to be used only first  to protect the constitution from violation  secondly  the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has been probably disregarded or not well understood  and  thirdly  to prevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of minorities  in reference to the second of these objects i may observe that i consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed points of the constitution arising from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given  and i believe with mr  madison that  repeated recognitions under varied circumstances in acts of the legislative  executive  and judicial branches of the government  accompanied by indications in different modes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation   as affording to the president sufficient authority for his considering such disputed points as settled   upward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present form of government  it would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise situation could be ascertained  a fair exhibit made of the operations of each of its departments  of the powers which they respectively claim and exercise  of the collisions which have occurred between them or between the whole government and those of the states or either of them  we could then compare our actual condition after fifty years  trial of our system with what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain whether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the confident hopes of its advocates have been best realized  the great dread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the states would be absorbed by those of the federal government and a consolidated power established  leaving to the states the shadow only of that independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on the preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty  without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of being realized  it is obvious that they did not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment the general government has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the states  as far as any open warfare may have gone  the state authorities have amply maintained their rights  to a casual observer our system presents no appearance of discord between the different members which compose it  even the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring  they move in their respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other  but there is still an undercurrent at work by which  if not seasonably checked  the worst apprehensions of our antifederal patriots will be realized  and not only will the state authorities be overshadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department of the general government  but the character of that government  if not its designation  be essentially and radically changed  this state of things has been in part effected by causes inherent in the constitution and in part by the never failing tendency of political power to increase itself  by making the president the sole distributer of all the patronage of the government the framers of the constitution do not appear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument to control the free operations of the state governments  of trifling importance at first  it had early in mr  jefferson s administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise  if such could have then been the effects of its influence  how much greater must be the danger at this time  quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more completely under the control of the executive will than their construction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all the early presidents permitted them to make  but it is not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department has become dangerous  but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country  the constitution has declared it to be the duty of the president to see that the laws are executed  and it makes him the commander in chief of the armies and navy of the united states  if the opinion of the most approved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern europe is termed monarchy in contradistinction to despotism is correct  there was wanting no other addition to the powers of our chief magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our government but the control of the public finances  and to me it appears strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the president possesses over the officers who have the custody of the public money  by the power of removal with or without cause  does  for all mischievous purposes at least  virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal  the first roman emperor  in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure  silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword  by a selection of political instruments for the care of the public money a reference to their commissions by a president would be quite as effectual an argument as that of caesar to the roman knight  i am not insensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe  keeping and disbursement of the public revenues  and i know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the divorce  as it is called  of the treasury from the banking institutions it is not the divorce which is complained of  but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department  which has created such extensive alarm  to this danger to our republican institutions and that created by the influence given to the executive through the instrumentality of the federal officers i propose to apply all the remedies which may be at my command  it was certainly a great error in the framers of the constitution not to have made the officer at the head of the treasury department entirely independent of the executive  he should at least have been removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislature  i have determined never to remove a secretary of the treasury without communicating all the circumstances attending such removal to both houses of congress   the influence of the executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by mr  jefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes  and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments  never with my consent shall an officer of the people  compensated for his services out of their pockets  become the pliant instrument of executive will   there is no part of the means placed in the hands of the executive which might be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the control of the public press  the maxim which our ancestors derived from the mother country that  the freedom of the press is the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty  is one of the most precious legacies which they have left us  we have learned  too  from our own as well as the experience of other countries  that golden shackles  by whomsoever or by whatever pretense imposed  are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of despotism  the presses in the necessary employment of the government should never be used  to clear the guilty or to varnish crime   a decent and manly examination of the acts of the government should be not only tolerated  but encouraged   upon another occasion i have given my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of executive interference in the legislation of congress  that the article in the constitution making it the duty of the president to communicate information and authorizing him to recommend measures was not intended to make him the source in legislation  and  in particular  that he should never be looked to for schemes of finance  it would be very strange  indeed  that the constitution should have strictly forbidden one branch of the legislature from interfering in the origination of such bills and that it should be considered proper that an altogether different department of the government should be permitted to do so  some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle  there are others  however  which can not be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief  and this i conceive to be one  no matter in which of the houses of parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced  a minister or a member of the opposition   by the fiction of law  or rather of constitutional principle  the sovereign is supposed to have prepared it agreeably to his will and then submitted it to parliament for their advice and consent  now the very reverse is the case here  not only with regard to the principle  but the forms prescribed by the constitution  the principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the constitution  the legislative body  the power to make laws  and the forms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them  the senate  in relation to revenue bills  have the right to propose amendments  and so has the executive by the power given him to return them to the house of representatives with his objections  it is in his power also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws  suggested by his observations upon their defective or injurious operation  but the delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the constitution has placed it  with the immediate representatives of the people  for similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure should be prescribed by them  and the further removed it may be from the control of the executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle   connected with this subject is the character of the currency  the idea of making it exclusively metallic  however well intended  appears to me to be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having no relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been devised  if any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellow citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth  that is the one  if there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things so much deprecated by all true republicans  by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury  it is an exclusive metallic currency  or if there is a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury  it is an exclusive metallic currency   amongst the other duties of a delicate character which the president is called upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the territories of the united states  those of them which are destined to become members of our great political family are compensated by their rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political rights  it is in this district only where american citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future  their only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp  that their sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within  are there any of their countrymen  who would subject them to greater sacrifices  to any other humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they were thus separated from their fellow citizens  are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the application of those great principles upon which all our constitutions are founded  we are told by the greatest of british orators and statesmen that at the commencement of the war of the revolution the most stupid men in england spoke of  their american subjects   are there  indeed  citizens of any of our states who have dreamed of their subjects in the district of columbia  such dreams can never be realized by any agency of mine  the people of the district of columbia are not the subjects of the people of the states  but free american citizens  being in the latter condition when the constitution was formed  no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character  if there is anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our declaration of independence  they could neither make nor the united states accept a surrender of their liberties and become the subjects  in other words  the slaves  of their former fellow citizens  if this be true  and it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an american citizen  the grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia can be interpreted  so far as respects the aggregate people of the united states  as meaning nothing more than to allow to congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the general government by the constitution  in all other respects the legislation of congress should be adapted to their peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their deliberate opinions of their own interests   i have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of the government  as well as all the other authorities of our country  within their appropriate orbits  this is a matter of difficulty in some cases  as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined by any distinct lines  mischievous  however  in their tendencies as collisions of this kind may be  those which arise between the respective communities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more so  for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states  strong as is the tie of interest  it has been often found ineffectual  men blinded by their passions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestions of policy  the alternative  then  is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good one  and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our american political architects have reared the fabric of our government  the cement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the affectionate attachment between all its members  to insure the continuance of this feeling  produced at first by a community of dangers  of sufferings  and of interests  the advantages of each were made accessible to all  no participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive confederacy  except in domestic government  was withheld from the citizen of any other member  by a process attended with no difficulty  no delay  no expense but that of removal  the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other  and successively of the whole  the lines  too  separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one state from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding  the citizens of each state unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the united states  but in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen of two separate states  and he is therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserved powers of any state but that of which he is for the time being a citizen  he may  indeed  offer to the citizens of other states his advice as to their management  and the form in which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of propriety  it may be observed  however  that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of athens to her allies  supported by an armed and powerful fleet  it was  indeed  to the ambition of the leading states of greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the destruction of that celebrated confederacy  and subsequently of all its members  is mainly to be attributed  and it is owing to the absence of that spirit that the helvetic confederacy has for so many years been preserved  never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate members of any confederacy more elements of discord  in the principles and forms of government and religion  as well as in the circumstances of the several cantons  so marked a discrepancy was observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance  and yet for ages neither has been interrupted  content with the positive benefits which their union produced  with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secured  these sagacious people respected the institutions of each other  however repugnant to their own principles and prejudices   our confederacy  fellow citizens  can only be preserved by the same forbearance  our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the constitution clothes them  the attempt of those of one state to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of distrust and jealousy  the certain harbingers of disunion  violence  and civil war  and the ultimate destruction of our free institutions  our confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership there is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied members  but that which has been reserved by the individual members is intangible by the common government or the individual members composing it  to attempt it finds no support in the principles of our constitution   it should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our confederacy  experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by citizens of one part of the union of a subject not confided to the general government  but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authorities  is productive of no other consequences than bitterness  alienation  discord  and injury to the very cause which is intended to be advanced  of all the great interests which appertain to our country  that of union  cordial  confiding  fraternal union  is by far the most important  since it is the only true and sure guaranty of all others   in consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency  some of the states may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns  however deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagements into which states have entered for purposes of their own  it does not become us to disparage the states governments  nor to discourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief  on the contrary  it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their engagements and maintain their credit  for the character and credit of the several states form a part of the character and credit of the whole country  the resources of the country are abundant  the enterprise and activity of our people proverbial  and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective governments  each acting within its own sphere  will restore former prosperity   unpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the constituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to the lines which separate their respective jurisdictions  the results can be of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism  that devoted attachment to liberty  that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished  continue to be cherished  if this continues to be the ruling passion of our souls  the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected  the utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated  and the complicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless  the spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive  on the contrary  no care that can be used in the construction of our government  no division of powers  no distribution of checks in its several departments  will prove effectual to keep us a free people if this spirit is suffered to decay  and decay it will without constant nurture  to the neglect of this duty the best historians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose existence and fall their writings have made us acquainted  the same causes will ever produce the same effects  and as long as the love of power is a dominant passion of the human bosom  and as long as the understandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by operations upon their passions and prejudices  so long will the liberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation  the danger to all well established free governments arises from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of designing men diverting their attention from the quarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come  this is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their country  in the name of democracy they speak  warning the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy  history  ancient and modern  is full of such examples  caesar became the master of the roman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the democratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter  cromwell  in the character of protector of the liberties of the people  became the dictator of england  and bolivar possessed himself of unlimited power with the title of his country s liberator  there is  on the contrary  no instance on record of an extensive and well  established republic being changed into an aristocracy  the tendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy  and the antagonist principle to liberty there is the spirit of faction  a spirit which assumes the character and in times of great excitement imposes itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom  and  like the false christs whose coming was foretold by the savior  seeks to  and were it possible would  impose upon the true and most faithful disciples of liberty  it is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power  and although there is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the false from the true spirit  a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit  as well by the character of its operations as the results that are produced  the true spirit of liberty  although devoted  persevering  bold  and uncompromising in principle  that secured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs  whilst the spirit of party  assuming to be that of liberty  is harsh  vindictive  and intolerant  and totally reckless as to the character of the allies which it brings to the aid of its cause  when the genuine spirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affairs  it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments of the government  and restores the system to its pristine health and beauty  but the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and established amidst unusual professions of devotion to democracy   the foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected with our domestic concerns  it may be proper  however  that i should give some indications to my fellow citizens of my proposed course of conduct in the management of our foreign relations  i assure them  therefore  that it is my intention to use every means in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with every foreign nation  and that although  of course  not well informed as to the state of pending negotiations with any of them  i see in the personal characters of the sovereigns  as well as in the mutual interests of our own and of the governments with which our relations are most intimate  a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the interests of their subjects as well as of our citizens will not be interrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their part to which our honor would not permit us to yield  long the defender of my country s rights in the field  i trust that my fellow citizens will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers any indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of the nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their chief magistrate unworthy of their former glory  in our intercourse with our aboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the course prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when acting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed  i can conceive of no more sublime spectacle  none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common creator  than a rigid adherence to the principles of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with a weaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its disposal   before concluding  fellow citizens  i must say something to you on the subject of the parties at this time existing in our country  to me it appears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that the violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time governed must be greatly mitigated  if not entirely extinguished  or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of   if parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionaries within the bounds of law and duty  at that point their usefulness ends  beyond that they become destructive of public virtue  the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty  and eventually its inevitable conqueror  we have examples of republics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citizens  and yet  with the continuance of the name and forms of free government  not a vestige of these qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens  it was the beautiful remark of a distinguished english writer that  in the roman senate octavius had a party and anthony a party  but the commonwealth had none   yet the senate continued to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the commonwealth and gaze at the statues of the elder brutus and of the curtii and decii  and the people assembled in the forum  not  as in the days of camillus and the scipios  to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass upon the acts of the senate  but to receive from the hands of the leaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout for one or the other  as those collected in gaul or egypt and the lesser asia would furnish the larger dividend  the spirit of liberty had fled  and  avoiding the abodes of civilized man  had sought protection in the wilds of scythia or scandinavia  and so under the operation of the same causes and influences it will fly from our capitol and our forums  a calamity so awful  not only to our country  but to the world  must be deprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things likely to produce it immediately checked  such a tendency has existed  does exist  always the friend of my countrymen  never their flatterer  it becomes my duty to say to them from this high place to which their partiality has exalted me that there exists in the land a spirit hostile to their best interests  hostile to liberty itself  it is a spirit contracted in its views  selfish in its objects  it looks to the aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interests of the whole  the entire remedy is with the people  something  however  may be effected by the means which they have placed in my hands  it is union that we want  not of a party for the sake of that party  but a union of the whole country for the sake of the whole country  for the defense of its interests and its honor against foreign aggression  for the defense of those principles for which our ancestors so gloriously contended as far as it depends upon me it shall be accomplished  all the influence that i possess shall be exerted to prevent the formation at least of an executive party in the halls of the legislative body  i wish for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not satisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds his appointment  nor any confidence in advance from the people but that asked for by mr  jefferson   to give firmness and effect to the legal administration of their affairs    i deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify me in expressing to my fellow citizens a profound reverence for the christian religion and a thorough conviction that sound morals  religious liberty  and a just sense of religious responsibility are essentially connected with all true and lasting happiness  and to that good being who has blessed us by the gifts of civil and religious freedom  who watched over and prospered the labors of our fathers and has hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence those of any other people  let us unite in fervently commending every interest of our beloved country in all future time   fellow citizens  being fully invested with that high office to which the partiality of my countrymen has called me  i now take an affectionate leave of you  you will bear with you to your homes the remembrance of the pledge i have this day given to discharge all the high duties of my exalted station according to the best of my ability  and i shall enter upon their performance with entire confidence in the support of a just and generous people  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  without solicitation on my part  i have been chosen by the free and voluntary suffrages of my countrymen to the most honorable and most responsible office on earth  i am deeply impressed with gratitude for the confidence reposed in me  honored with this distinguished consideration at an earlier period of life than any of my predecessors  i can not disguise the diffidence with which i am about to enter on the discharge of my official duties   if the more aged and experienced men who have filled the office of president of the united states even in the infancy of the republic distrusted their ability to discharge the duties of that exalted station  what ought not to be the apprehensions of one so much younger and less endowed now that our domain extends from ocean to ocean  that our people have so greatly increased in numbers  and at a time when so great diversity of opinion prevails in regard to the principles and policy which should characterize the administration of our government  well may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring responsibilities on which may depend our country s peace and prosperity  and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family   in assuming responsibilities so vast i fervently invoke the aid of that almighty ruler of the universe in whose hands are the destinies of nations and of men to guard this heaven favored land against the mischiefs which without his guidance might arise from an unwise public policy  with a firm reliance upon the wisdom of omnipotence to sustain and direct me in the path of duty which i am appointed to pursue  i stand in the presence of this assembled multitude of my countrymen to take upon myself the solemn obligation  to the best of my ability to preserve  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states    a concise enumeration of the principles which will guide me in the administrative policy of the government is not only in accordance with the examples set me by all my predecessors  but is eminently befitting the occasion   the constitution itself  plainly written as it is  the safeguard of our federative compact  the offspring of concession and compromise  binding together in the bonds of peace and union this great and increasing family of free and independent states  will be the chart by which i shall be directed   it will be my first care to administer the government in the true spirit of that instrument  and to assume no powers not expressly granted or clearly implied in its terms  the government of the united states is one of delegated and limited powers  arid it is by a strict adherence to the clearly granted powers and by abstaining from the exercise of doubtful or unauthorized implied powers that we have the only sure guaranty against the recurrence of those unfortunate collisions between the federal and state authorities which have occasionally so much disturbed the harmony of our system and even threatened the perpetuity of our glorious union    to the states  respectively  or to the people  have been reserved  the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states   each state is a complete sovereignty within the sphere of its reserved powers  the government of the union  acting within the sphere of its delegated authority  is also a complete sovereignty  while the general government should abstain from the exercise of authority not clearly delegated to it  the states should be equally careful that in the maintenance of their rights they do not overstep the limits of powers reserved to them  one of the most distinguished of my predecessors attached deserved importance to  the support of the state governments in all their rights  as the most competent administration for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwark against antirepublican tendencies   and to the  preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor  as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad    to the government of the united states has been intrusted the exclusive management of our foreign affairs  beyond that it wields a few general enumerated powers  it does not force reform on the states  it leaves individuals  over whom it casts its protecting influence  entirely free to improve their own condition by the legitimate exercise of all their mental and physical powers  it is a common protector of each and all the states  of every man who lives upon our soil  whether of native or foreign birth  of every religious sect  in their worship of the almighty according to the dictates of their own conscience  of every shade of opinion  and the most free inquiry  of every art  trade  and occupation consistent with the laws of the states  and we rejoice in the general happiness  prosperity  and advancement of our country  which have been the offspring of freedom  and not of power   this most admirable and wisest system of well regulated self government among men ever devised by human minds has been tested by its successful operation for more than half a century  and if preserved from the usurpations of the federal government on the one hand and the exercise by the states of powers not reserved to them on the other  will  i fervently hope and believe  endure for ages to come and dispense the blessings of civil and religious liberty to distant generations  to effect objects so dear to every patriot i shall devote myself with anxious solicitude  it will be my desire to guard against that most fruitful source of danger to the harmonious action of our system which consists in substituting the mere discretion and caprice of the executive or of majorities in the legislative department of the government for powers which have been withheld from the federal government by the constitution  by the theory of our government majorities rule  but this right is not an arbitrary or unlimited one  it is a right to be exercised in subordination to the constitution and in conformity to it  one great object of the constitution was to restrain majorities from oppressing minorities or encroaching upon their just rights  minorities have a right to appeal to the constitution as a shield against such oppression   that the blessings of liberty which our constitution secures may be enjoyed alike by minorities and majorities  the executive has been wisely invested with a qualified veto upon the acts of the legislature  it is a negative power  and is conservative in its character  it arrests for the time hasty  inconsiderate  or unconstitutional legislation  invites reconsideration  and transfers questions at issue between the legislative and executive departments to the tribunal of the people  like all other powers  it is subject to be abused  when judiciously and properly exercised  the constitution itself may be saved from infraction and the rights of all preserved and protected   the inestimable value of our federal union is felt and acknowledged by all  by this system of united and confederated states our people are permitted collectively arid individually to seek their own happiness in their own way  and the consequences have been most auspicious  since the union was formed the number of the states has increased from thirteen to twenty eight  two of these have taken their position as members of the confederacy within the last week  our population has increased from three to twenty millions  new communities and states are seeking protection under its aegis  and multitudes from the old world are flocking to our shores to participate in its blessings  beneath its benign sway peace and prosperity prevail  freed from the burdens and miseries of war  our trade and intercourse have extended throughout the world  mind  no longer tasked in devising means to accomplish or resist schemes of ambition  usurpation  or conquest  is devoting itself to man s true interests in developing his faculties and powers and the capacity of nature to minister to his enjoyments  genius is free to announce its inventions and discoveries  and the hand is free to accomplish whatever the head conceives not incompatible with the rights of a fellow being  all distinctions of birth or of rank have been abolished  all citizens  whether native or adopted  are placed upon terms of precise equality  all are entitled to equal rights and equal protection  no union exists between church and state  and perfect freedom of opinion is guaranteed to all sects and creeds   these are some of the blessings secured to our happy land by our federal union  to perpetuate them it is our sacred duty to preserve it  who shall assign limits to the achievements of free minds and free hands under the protection of this glorious union  no treason to mankind since the organization of society would be equal in atrocity to that of him who would lift his hand to destroy it  he would overthrow the noblest structure of human wisdom  which protects himself and his fellow man  he would stop the progress of free government and involve his country either in anarchy or despotism  he would extinguish the fire of liberty  which warms and animates the hearts of happy millions and invites all the nations of the earth to imitate our example  if he say that error and wrong are committed in the administration of the government  let him remember that nothing human can be perfect  and that under no other system of government revealed by heaven or devised by man has reason been allowed so free and broad a scope to combat error  has the sword of despots proved to be a safer or surer instrument of reform in government than enlightened reason  does he expect to find among the ruins of this union a happier abode for our swarming millions than they now have under it  every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution  and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment   our federal union    it must be preserved   to preserve it the compromises which alone enabled our fathers to form a common constitution for the government and protection of so many states and distinct communities  of such diversified habits  interests  and domestic institutions  must be sacredly and religiously observed  any attempt to disturb or destroy these compromises  being terms of the compact of union  can lead to none other than the most ruinous and disastrous consequences   it is a source of deep regret that in some sections of our country misguided persons have occasionally indulged in schemes and agitations whose object is the destruction of domestic institutions existing in other sections    institutions which existed at the adoption of the constitution and were recognized and protected by it  all must see that if it were possible for them to be successful in attaining their object the dissolution of the union and the consequent destruction of our happy form of government must speedily follow   i am happy to believe that at every period of our existence as a nation there has existed  and continues to exist  among the great mass of our people a devotion to the union of the states which will shield and protect it against the moral treason of any who would seriously contemplate its destruction  to secure a continuance of that devotion the compromises of the constitution must not only be preserved  but sectional jealousies and heartburnings must be discountenanced  and all should remember that they are members of the same political family  having a common destiny  to increase the attachment of our people to the union  our laws should be just  any policy which shall tend to favor monopolies or the peculiar interests of sections or classes must operate to the prejudice of the interest of their fellow citizens  and should be avoided  if the compromises of the constitution be preserved  if sectional jealousies and heartburnings be discountenanced  if our laws be just and the government be practically administered strictly within the limits of power prescribed to it  we may discard all apprehensions for the safety of the union   with these views of the nature  character  and objects of the government and the value of the union  i shall steadily oppose the creation of those institutions and systems which in their nature tend to pervert it from its legitimate purposes and make it the instrument of sections  classes  and individuals  we need no national banks or other extraneous institutions planted around the government to control or strengthen it in opposition to the will of its authors  experience has taught us how unnecessary they are as auxiliaries of the public authorities    how impotent for good and how powerful for mischief   ours was intended to be a plain and frugal government  and i shall regard it to be my duty to recommend to congress and  as far as the executive is concerned  to enforce by all the means within my power the strictest economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be compatible with the public interests   a national debt has become almost an institution of european monarchies  it is viewed in some of them as an essential prop to existing governments  melancholy is the condition of that people whose government can be sustained only by a system which periodically transfers large amounts from the labor of the many to the coffers of the few  such a system is incompatible with the ends for which our republican government was instituted  under a wise policy the debts contracted in our revolution and during the war of 1812 have been happily extinguished  by a judicious application of the revenues not required for other necessary purposes  it is not doubted that the debt which has grown out of the circumstances of the last few years may be speedily paid off   i congratulate my fellow citizens on the entire restoration of the credit of the general government of the union and that of many of the states  happy would it be for the indebted states if they were freed from their liabilities  many of which were incautiously contracted  although the government of the union is neither in a legal nor a moral sense bound for the debts of the states  and it would be a violation of our compact of union to assume them  yet we can not but feel a deep interest in seeing all the states meet their public liabilities and pay off their just debts at the earliest practicable period  that they will do so as soon as it can be done without imposing too heavy burdens on their citizens there is no reason to doubt  the sound moral and honorable feeling of the people of the indebted states can not be questioned  and we are happy to perceive a settled disposition on their part  as their ability returns after a season of unexampled pecuniary embarrassment  to pay off all just demands and to acquiesce in any reasonable measures to accomplish that object   one of the difficulties which we have had to encounter in the practical administration of the government consists in the adjustment of our revenue laws and the levy of the taxes necessary for the support of government  in the general proposition that no more money shall be collected than the necessities of an economical administration shall require all parties seem to acquiesce  nor does there seem to be any material difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the government to tax one section of country  or one class of citizens  or one occupation  for the mere profit of another   justice and sound policy forbid the federal government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of another  or to cherish the interests of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country   i have heretofore declared to my fellow citizens that  in my judgment it is the duty of the government to extend  as far as it may be practicable to do so  by its revenue laws and all other means within its power  fair and just protection to all of the great interests of the whole union  embracing agriculture  manufactures  the mechanic arts  commerce  and navigation   i have also declared my opinion to be  in favor of a tariff for revenue   and that  in adjusting the details of such a tariff i have sanctioned such moderate discriminating duties as would produce the amount of revenue needed and at the same time afford reasonable incidental protection to our home industry   and that i was  opposed to a tariff for protection merely  and not for revenue    the power  to lay and collect taxes  duties  imposts  and excises  was an indispensable one to be conferred on the federal government  which without it would possess no means of providing for its own support  in executing this power by levying a tariff of duties for the support of government  the raising of revenue should be the object and protection the incident  to reverse this principle and make protection the object and revenue the incident would be to inflict manifest injustice upon all other than the protected interests  in levying duties for revenue it is doubtless proper to make such discriminations within the revenue principle as will afford incidental protection to our home interests  within the revenue limit there is a discretion to discriminate  beyond that limit the rightful exercise of the power is not conceded  the incidental protection afforded to our home interests by discriminations within the revenue range it is believed will be ample  in making discriminations all our home interests should as far as practicable be equally protected  the largest portion of our people are agriculturists  others are employed in manufactures  commerce  navigation  and the mechanic arts  they are all engaged in their respective pursuits and their joint labors constitute the national or home industry  to tax one branch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust  no one of these interests can rightfully claim an advantage over the others  or to be enriched by impoverishing the others  all are equally entitled to the fostering care and protection of the government  in exercising a sound discretion in levying discriminating duties within the limit prescribed  care should be taken that it be done in a manner not to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the toiling millions by taxing lowest the luxuries of life  or articles of superior quality and high price  which can only be consumed by the wealthy  and highest the necessaries of life  or articles of coarse quality and low price  which the poor and great mass of our people must consume  the burdens of government should as far as practicable be distributed justly and equally among all classes of our population  these general views  long entertained on this subject  i have deemed it proper to reiterate  it is a subject upon which conflicting interests of sections and occupations are supposed to exist  and a spirit of mutual concession and compromise in adjusting its details should be cherished by every part of our widespread country as the only means of preserving harmony and a cheerful acquiescence of all in the operation of our revenue laws  our patriotic citizens in every part of the union will readily submit to the payment of such taxes as shall be needed for the support of their government  whether in peace or in war  if they are so levied as to distribute the burdens as equally as possible among them   the republic of texas has made known her desire to come into our union  to form a part of our confederacy and enjoy with us the blessings of liberty secured and guaranteed by our constitution  texas was once a part of our country    was unwisely ceded away to a foreign power    is now independent  and possesses an undoubted right to dispose of a part or the whole of her territory and to merge her sovereignty as a separate and independent state in ours  i congratulate my country that by an act of the late congress of the united states the assent of this government has been given to the reunion  and it only remains for the two countries to agree upon the terms to consummate an object so important to both   i regard the question of annexation as belonging exclusively to the united states and texas  they are independent powers competent to contract  and foreign nations have no right to interfere with them or to take exceptions to their reunion  foreign powers do not seem to appreciate the true character of our government  our union is confederation of independent states  whose policy is peace with each other and all the world  to enlarge its limits is to extend the dominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions  the world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our government  while the chief magistrate and the popular branch of congress are elected for short terms by the suffrages of those millions who must in their own persons bear all the burdens and miseries of war  our government can not be otherwise than pacific  foreign powers should therefore look on the annexation of texas to the united states not as the conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and violence  but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own  by adding another member to our confederation  with the consent of that member  thereby diminishing the chances of war and opening to them new and ever increasing markets for their products   to texas the reunion is important  because the strong protecting arm of our government would be extended over her  and the vast resources of her fertile soil and genial climate would be speedily developed  while the safety of new orleans and of our whole southwestern frontier against hostile aggression  as well as the interests of the whole union  would be promoted by it   in the earlier stages of our national existence the opinion prevailed with some that our system of confederated states could not operate successfully over an extended territory  and serious objections have at different times been made to the enlargement of our boundaries  these objections were earnestly urged when we acquired louisiana  experience has shown that they were not well founded  the title of numerous indian tribes to vast tracts of country has been extinguished  new states have been admitted into the union  new territories have been created and our jurisdiction and laws extended over them  as our population has expanded  the union has been cemented and strengthened  as our boundaries have been enlarged and our agricultural population has been spread over a large surface  our federative system has acquired additional strength and security  it may well be doubted whether it would not be in greater danger of overthrow if our present population were confined to the comparatively narrow limits of the original thirteen states than it is now that they are sparsely settled over a more expanded territory  it is confidently believed that our system may be safely extended to the utmost bounds of our territorial limits  and that as it shall be extended the bonds of our union  so far from being weakened  will become stronger   none can fail to see the danger to our safety and future peace if texas remains an independent state or becomes an ally or dependency of some foreign nation more powerful than herself  is there one among our citizens who would not prefer perpetual peace with texas to occasional wars  which so often occur between bordering independent nations  is there one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties on all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross her frontiers  is there one who would not prefer an unrestricted communication with her citizens to the frontier obstructions which must occur if she remains out of the union  whatever is good or evil in the local institutions of texas will remain her own whether annexed to the united states or not  none of the present states will be responsible for them any more than they are for the local institutions of each other  they have confederated together for certain specified objects  upon the same principle that they would refuse to form a perpetual union with texas because of her local institutions our forefathers would have been prevented from forming our present union  perceiving no valid objection to the measure and many reasons for its adoption vitally affecting the peace  the safety  and the prosperity of both countries  i shall on the broad principle which formed the basis and produced the adoption of our constitution  and not in any narrow spirit of sectional policy  endeavor by all constitutional  honorable  and appropriate means to consummate the expressed will of the people and government of the united states by the reannexation of texas to our union at the earliest practicable period   nor will it become in a less degree my duty to assert and maintain by all constitutional means the right of the united states to that portion of our territory which lies beyond the rocky mountains  our title to the country of the oregon is  clear and unquestionable   and already are our people preparing to perfect that title by occupying it with their wives and children  but eighty years ago our population was confined on the west by the ridge of the alleghanies  within that period  within the lifetime  i might say  of some of my hearers  our people  increasing to many millions  have filled the eastern valley of the mississippi  adventurously ascended the missouri to its headsprings  and are already engaged in establishing the blessings of self government in valleys of which the rivers flow to the pacific  the world beholds the peaceful triumphs of the industry of our emigrants  to us belongs the duty of protecting them adequately wherever they may be upon our soil  the jurisdiction of our laws and the benefits of our republican institutions should be extended over them in the distant regions which they have selected for their homes  the increasing facilities of intercourse will easily bring the states  of which the formation in that part of our territory can not be long delayed  within the sphere of our federative union  in the meantime every obligation imposed by treaty or conventional stipulations should be sacredly respected   in the management of our foreign relations it will be my aim to observe a careful respect for the rights of other nations  while our own will be the subject of constant watchfulness  equal and exact justice should characterize all our intercourse with foreign countries  all alliances having a tendency to jeopard the welfare and honor of our country or sacrifice any one of the national interests will be studiously avoided  and yet no opportunity will be lost to cultivate a favorable understanding with foreign governments by which our navigation and commerce may be extended and the ample products of our fertile soil  as well as the manufactures of our skillful artisans  find a ready market and remunerating prices in foreign countries   in taking  care that the laws be faithfully executed   a strict performance of duty will be exacted from all public officers  from those officers  especially  who are charged with the collection and disbursement of the public revenue will prompt and rigid accountability be required  any culpable failure or delay on their part to account for the moneys intrusted to them at the times and in the manner required by law will in every instance terminate the official connection of such defaulting officer with the government   although in our country the chief magistrate must almost of necessity be chosen by a party and stand pledged to its principles and measures  yet in his official action he should not be the president of a part only  but of the whole people of the united states  while he executes the laws with an impartial hand  shrinks from no proper responsibility  and faithfully carries out in the executive department of the government the principles and policy of those who have chosen him  he should not be unmindful that our fellow citizens who have differed with him in opinion are entitled to the full and free exercise of their opinions and judgments  and that the rights of all are entitled to respect and regard   confidently relying upon the aid and assistance of the coordinate departments of the government in conducting our public affairs  i enter upon the discharge of the high duties which have been assigned me by the people  again humbly supplicating that divine being who has watched over and protected our beloved country from its infancy to the present hour to continue his gracious benedictions upon us  that we may continue to be a prosperous and happy people  ',\n",
       " 'elected by the american people to the highest office known to our laws  i appear here to take the oath prescribed by the constitution  and  in compliance with a time honored custom  to address those who are now assembled   the confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be the chief magistrate of a republic holding a high rank among the nations of the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude  but when i reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous duties and involves the weightiest obligations  i am conscious that the position which i have been called to fill  though sufficient to satisfy the loftiest ambition  is surrounded by fearful responsibilities  happily  however  in the performance of my new duties i shall not be without able cooperation  the legislative and judicial branches of the government present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments and matured experience  and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the executive departments individuals whose talents  integrity  and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the faithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to their charge  with such aids and an honest purpose to do whatever is right  i hope to execute diligently  impartially  and for the best interests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me   in the discharge of these duties my guide will be the constitution  which i this day swear to  preserve  protect  and defend   for the interpretation of that instrument i shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of the government under the earlier presidents  who had so large a share in its formation  to the example of those illustrious patriots i shall always defer with reverence  and especially to his example who was by so many titles  the father of his country    to command the army and navy of the united states  with the advice and consent of the senate  to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other officers  to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary  and to take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed    these are the most important functions intrusted to the president by the constitution  and it may be expected that i shall briefly indicate the principles which will control me in their execution   chosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country  and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest  i this day renew the declarations i have heretofore made and proclaim my fixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the government in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public policy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of our national existence   in reference to the army and navy  lately employed with so much distinction on active service  care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency  and in furtherance of that object the military and naval schools  sustained by the liberality of congress  shall receive the special attention of the executive   as american freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty  but at the same time we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations  in all disputes between conflicting governments it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral  while our geographical position  the genius of our institutions and our people  the advancing spirit of civilization  and  above all  the dictates of religion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations with all other powers  it is to be hoped that no international question can now arise which a government confident in its own strength and resolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise negotiation  and it eminently becomes a government like our own  founded on the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their affections  to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before appealing to arms  in the conduct of our foreign relations i shall conform to these views  as i believe them essential to the best interests and the true honor of the country   the appointing power vested in the president imposes delicate and onerous duties  so far as it is possible to be informed  i shall make honesty  capacity  and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of office  and the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal   it shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to congress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and protection to the great interests of agriculture  commerce  and manufactures  to improve our rivers and harbors  to provide for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt  to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all officers of the government and the utmost economy in all public expenditures  but it is for the wisdom of congress itself  in which all legislative powers are vested by the constitution  to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy  i shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections  in any action calculated to promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his country i will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the government   in conclusion i congratulate you  my fellow citizens  upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of divine providence has conducted our common country  let us invoke a continuance of the same protecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence we this day occupy  and let us seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our councils  by well directed attempts to assuage the bitterness which too often marks unavoidable differences of opinion  by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal principles  and by an enlarged patriotism  which shall acknowledge no limits but those of our own widespread republic  ',\n",
       " 'my countrymen  it a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know the personal regret and bitter sorrow over which i have been borne to a position so suitable for others rather than desirable for myself   the circumstances under which i have been called for a limited period to preside over the destinies of the republic fill me with a profound sense of responsibility  but with nothing like shrinking apprehension  i repair to the post assigned me not as to one sought  but in obedience to the unsolicited expression of your will  answerable only for a fearless  faithful  and diligent exercise of my best powers  i ought to be  and am  truly grateful for the rare manifestation of the nation s confidence  but this  so far from lightening my obligations  only adds to their weight  you have summoned me in my weakness  you must sustain me by your strength  when looking for the fulfillment of reasonable requirements  you will not be unmindful of the great changes which have occurred  even within the last quarter of a century  and the consequent augmentation and complexity of duties imposed in the administration both of your home and foreign affairs   whether the elements of inherent force in the republic have kept pace with its unparalleled progression in territory  population  and wealth has been the subject of earnest thought and discussion on both sides of the ocean  less than sixty four years ago the father of his country made  the  then  recent accession of the important state of north carolina to the constitution of the united states  one of the subjects of his special congratulation  at that moment  however  when the agitation consequent upon the revolutionary struggle had hardly subsided  when we were just emerging from the weakness and embarrassments of the confederation  there was an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the great mission so wisely and bravely fulfilled by our fathers  it was not a presumptuous assurance  but a calm faith  springing from a clear view of the sources of power in a government constituted like ours  it is no paradox to say that although comparatively weak the new born nation was intrinsically strong  inconsiderable in population and apparent resources  it was upheld by a broad and intelligent comprehension of rights and an all pervading purpose to maintain them  stronger than armaments  it came from the furnace of the revolution  tempered to the necessities of the times  the thoughts of the men of that day were as practical as their sentiments were patriotic  they wasted no portion of their energies upon idle and delusive speculations  but with a firm and fearless step advanced beyond the governmental landmarks which had hitherto circumscribed the limits of human freedom and planted their standard  where it has stood against dangers which have threatened from abroad  and internal agitation  which has at times fearfully menaced at home  they proved themselves equal to the solution of the great problem  to understand which their minds had been illuminated by the dawning lights of the revolution  the object sought was not a thing dreamed of  it was a thing realized  they had exhibited only the power to achieve  but  what all history affirms to be so much more unusual  the capacity to maintain  the oppressed throughout the world from that day to the present have turned their eyes hitherward  not to find those lights extinguished or to fear lest they should wane  but to be constantly cheered by their steady and increasing radiance   in this our country has  in my judgment  thus far fulfilled its highest duty to suffering humanity  it has spoken and will continue to speak  not only by its words  but by its acts  the language of sympathy  encouragement  and hope to those who earnestly listen to tones which pronounce for the largest rational liberty  but after all  the most animating encouragement and potent appeal for freedom will be its own history    its trials and its triumphs  preeminently  the power of our advocacy reposes in our example  but no example  be it remembered  can be powerful for lasting good  whatever apparent advantages may be gained  which is not based upon eternal principles of right and justice  our fathers decided for themselves  both upon the hour to declare and the hour to strike  they were their own judges of the circumstances under which it became them to pledge to each other  their lives  their fortunes  and their sacred honor  for the acquisition of the priceless inheritance transmitted to us  the energy with which that great conflict was opened and  under the guidance of a manifest and beneficent providence the uncomplaining endurance with which it was prosecuted to its consummation were only surpassed by the wisdom and patriotic spirit of concession which characterized all the counsels of the early fathers   one of the most impressive evidences of that wisdom is to be found in the fact that the actual working of our system has dispelled a degree of solicitude which at the outset disturbed bold hearts and far reaching intellects  the apprehension of dangers from extended territory  multiplied states  accumulated wealth  and augmented population has proved to be unfounded  the stars upon your banner have become nearly threefold their original number  your densely populated possessions skirt the shores of the two great oceans  and yet this vast increase of people and territory has not only shown itself compatible with the harmonious action of the states and federal government in their respective constitutional spheres  but has afforded an additional guaranty of the strength and integrity of both   with an experience thus suggestive and cheering  the policy of my administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion  indeed  it is not to be disguised that our attitude as a nation and our position on the globe render the acquisition of certain possessions not within our jurisdiction eminently important for our protection  if not in the future essential for the preservation of the rights of commerce and the peace of the world  should they be obtained  it will be through no grasping spirit  but with a view to obvious national interest and security  and in a manner entirely consistent with the strictest observance of national faith  we have nothing in our history or position to invite aggression  we have everything to beckon us to the cultivation of relations of peace and amity with all nations  purposes  therefore  at once just and pacific will be significantly marked in the conduct of our foreign affairs  i intend that my administration shall leave no blot upon our fair record  and trust i may safely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my constitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of our citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the tribunal of the civilized world  an administration would be unworthy of confidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influenced by the conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchased at a price so dear as that of national wrong or dishonor  it is not your privilege as a nation to speak of a distant past  the striking incidents of your history  replete with instruction and furnishing abundant grounds for hopeful confidence  are comprised in a period comparatively brief  but if your past is limited  your future is boundless  its obligations throng the unexplored pathway of advancement  and will be limitless as duration  hence a sound and comprehensive policy should embrace not less the distant future than the urgent present   the great objects of our pursuit as a people are best to be attained by peace  and are entirely consistent with the tranquillity and interests of the rest of mankind  with the neighboring nations upon our continent we should cultivate kindly and fraternal relations  we can desire nothing in regard to them so much as to see them consolidate their strength and pursue the paths of prosperity and happiness  if in the course of their growth we should open new channels of trade and create additional facilities for friendly intercourse  the benefits realized will be equal and mutual  of the complicated european systems of national polity we have heretofore been independent  from their wars  their tumults  and anxieties we have been  happily  almost entirely exempt  whilst these are confined to the nations which gave them existence  and within their legitimate jurisdiction  they can not affect us except as they appeal to our sympathies in the cause of human freedom and universal advancement  but the vast interests of commerce are common to all mankind  and the advantages of trade and international intercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence of a great people   with these views firmly and honestly carried out  we have a right to expect  and shall under all circumstances require  prompt reciprocity  the rights which belong to us as a nation are not alone to be regarded  but those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity  at home and abroad  must be sacredly maintained  so long as he can discern every star in its place upon that ensign  without wealth to purchase for him preferment or title to secure for him place  it will be his privilege  and must be his acknowledged right  to stand unabashed even in the presence of princes  with a proud consciousness that he is himself one of a nation of sovereigns and that he can not in legitimate pursuit wander so far from home that the agent whom he shall leave behind in the place which i now occupy will not see that no rude hand of power or tyrannical passion is laid upon him with impunity  he must realize that upon every sea and on every soil where our enterprise may rightfully seek the protection of our flag american citizenship is an inviolable panoply for the security of american rights  and in this connection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which should now be regarded as fundamental  the rights  security  and repose of this confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonization on this side of the ocean by any foreign power beyond present jurisdiction as utterly inadmissible   the opportunities of observation furnished by my brief experience as a soldier confirmed in my own mind the opinion  entertained and acted upon by others from the formation of the government  that the maintenance of large standing armies in our country would be not only dangerous  but unnecessary  they also illustrated the importance    i might well say the absolute necessity    of the military science and practical skill furnished in such an eminent degree by the institution which has made your army what it is  under the discipline and instruction of officers not more distinguished for their solid attainments  gallantry  and devotion to the public service than for unobtrusive bearing and high moral tone  the army as organized must be the nucleus around which in every time of need the strength of your military power  the sure bulwark of your defense    a national militia    may be readily formed into a well disciplined and efficient organization  and the skill and self devotion of the navy assure you that you may take the performance of the past as a pledge for the future  and may confidently expect that the flag which has waved its untarnished folds over every sea will still float in undiminished honor  but these  like many other subjects  will be appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the coordinate branches of the government  to which i shall always look with profound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord to me the aid and support which i shall so much need and which their experience and wisdom will readily suggest   in the administration of domestic affairs you expect a devoted integrity in the public service and an observance of rigid economy in all departments  so marked as never justly to be questioned  if this reasonable expectation be not realized  i frankly confess that one of your leading hopes is doomed to disappointment  and that my efforts in a very important particular must result in a humiliating failure  offices can be properly regarded only in the light of aids for the accomplishment of these objects  and as occupancy can confer no prerogative nor importunate desire for preferment any claim  the public interest imperatively demands that they be considered with sole reference to the duties to be performed  good citizens may well claim the protection of good laws and the benign influence of good government  but a claim for office is what the people of a republic should never recognize  no reasonable man of any party will expect the administration to be so regardless of its responsibility and of the obvious elements of success as to retain persons known to be under the influence of political hostility and partisan prejudice in positions which will require not only severe labor  but cordial cooperation  having no implied engagements to ratify  no rewards to bestow  no resentments to remember  and no personal wishes to consult in selections for official station  i shall fulfill this difficult and delicate trust  admitting no motive as worthy either of my character or position which does not contemplate an efficient discharge of duty and the best interests of my country  i acknowledge my obligations to the masses of my countrymen  and to them alone  higher objects than personal aggrandizement gave direction and energy to their exertions in the late canvass  and they shall not be disappointed  they require at my hands diligence  integrity  and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed  without these qualities in their public servants  more stringent laws for the prevention or punishment of fraud  negligence  and peculation will be vain  with them they will be unnecessary   but these are not the only points to which you look for vigilant watchfulness  the dangers of a concentration of all power in the general government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be disregarded  you have a right  therefore  to expect your agents in every department to regard strictly the limits imposed upon them by the constitution of the united states  the great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the state and federal authorities  and experience has shown that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just discrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the states and your common rights and obligations under the general government  and here  in my opinion  are the considerations which should form the true basis of future concord in regard to the questions which have most seriously disturbed public tranquillity  if the federal government will confine itself to the exercise of powers clearly granted by the constitution  it can hardly happen that its action upon any question should endanger the institutions of the states or interfere with their right to manage matters strictly domestic according to the will of their own people   in expressing briefly my views upon an important subject rich has recently agitated the nation to almost a fearful degree  i am moved by no other impulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that union which has made us what we are  showering upon us blessings and conferring a power and influence which our fathers could hardly have anticipated  even with their most sanguine hopes directed to a far off future  the sentiments i now announce were not unknown before the expression of the voice which called me here  my own position upon this subject was clear and unequivocal  upon the record of my words and my acts  and it is only recurred to at this time because silence might perhaps be misconstrued  with the union my best and dearest earthly hopes are entwined  without it what are we individually or collectively  what becomes of the noblest field ever opened for the advancement of our race in religion  in government  in the arts  and in all that dignifies and adorns mankind  from that radiant constellation which both illumines our own way and points out to struggling nations their course  let but a single star be lost  and  if these be not utter darkness  the luster of the whole is dimmed  do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while i possess the power to stay it  it is with me an earnest and vital belief that as the union has been the source  under providence  of our prosperity to this time  so it is the surest pledge of a continuance of the blessings we have enjoyed  and which we are sacredly bound to transmit undiminished to our children  the field of calm and free discussion in our country is open  and will always be so  but never has been and never can be traversed for good in a spirit of sectionalism and uncharitableness  the founders of the republic dealt with things as they were presented to them  in a spirit of self sacrificing patriotism  and  as time has proved  with a comprehensive wisdom which it will always be safe for us to consult  every measure tending to strengthen the fraternal feelings of all the members of our union has had my heartfelt approbation  to every theory of society or government  whether the offspring of feverish ambition or of morbid enthusiasm  calculated to dissolve the bonds of law and affection which unite us  i shall interpose a ready and stern resistance  i believe that involuntary servitude  as it exists in different states of this confederacy  is recognized by the constitution  i believe that it stands like any other admitted right  and that the states where it exists are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the constitutional provisions  i hold that the laws of 1850  commonly called the  compromise measures   are strictly constitutional and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect  i believe that the constituted authorities of this republic are bound to regard the rights of the south in this respect as they would view any other legal and constitutional right  and that the laws to enforce them should be respected and obeyed  not with a reluctance encouraged by abstract opinions as to their propriety in a different state of society  but cheerfully and according to the decisions of the tribunal to which their exposition belongs  such have been  and are  my convictions  and upon them i shall act  i fervently hope that the question is at rest  and that no sectional or ambitious or fanatical excitement may again threaten the durability of our institutions or obscure the light of our prosperity   but let not the foundation of our hope rest upon man s wisdom  it will not be sufficient that sectional prejudices find no place in the public deliberations  it will not be sufficient that the rash counsels of human passion are rejected  it must be felt that there is no national security but in the nation s humble  acknowledged dependence upon god and his overruling providence   we have been carried in safety through a perilous crisis  wise counsels  like those which gave us the constitution  prevailed to uphold it  let the period be remembered as an admonition  and not as an encouragement  in any section of the union  to make experiments where experiments are fraught with such fearful hazard  let it be impressed upon all hearts that  beautiful as our fabric is  no earthly power or wisdom could ever reunite its broken fragments  standing  as i do  almost within view of the green slopes of monticello  and  as it were  within reach of the tomb of washington  with all the cherished memories of the past gathering around me like so many eloquent voices of exhortation from heaven  i can express no better hope for my country than that the kind providence which smiled upon our fathers may enable their children to preserve the blessings they have inherited     ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  i appear before you this day to take the solemn oath  that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states    in entering upon this great office i must humbly invoke the god of our fathers for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible duties in such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship among the people of the several states and to preserve our free institutions throughout many generations  convinced that i owe my election to the inherent love for the constitution and the union which still animates the hearts of the american people  let me earnestly ask their powerful support in sustaining all just measures calculated to perpetuate these  the richest political blessings which heaven has ever bestowed upon any nation  having determined not to become a candidate for reelection  i shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administering the government except the desire ably and faithfull to serve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countrymen   we have recently passed through a presidential contest in which the passions of our fellow citizens were excited to the highest degree by questions of deep and vital importance  but when the people proclaimed their will the tempest at once subsided and all was calm   the voice of the majority  speaking in the manner prescribed by the constitution  was heard  and instant submission followed  our own country could alone have exhibited so grand and striking a spectacle of the capacity of man for self government   what a happy conception  then  was it for congress to apply this simple rule  that the will of the majority shall govern  to the settlement of the question of domestic slavery in the territories  congress is neither  to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom  but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way  subject only to the constitution of the united states    as a natural consequence  congress has also prescribed that when the territory of kansas shall be admitted as a state it  shall be received into the union with or without slavery  as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission    a difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the point of time when the people of a territory shall decide this question for themselves   this is  happily  a matter of but little practical importance  besides  it is a judicial question  which legitimately belongs to the supreme court of the united states  before whom it is now pending  and will  it is understood  be speedily and finally settled  to their decision  in common with all good citizens  i shall cheerfully submit  whatever this may be  though it has ever been my individual opinion that under the nebraska kansas act the appropriate period will be when the number of actual residents in the territory shall justify the formation of a constitution with a view to its admission as a state into the union  but be this as it may  it is the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the united states to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote  this sacred right of each individual must be preserved  that being accomplished  nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny for themselves  subject only to the constitution of the united states   the whole territorial question being thus settled upon the principle of popular sovereignty    a principle as ancient as free government itself  everything of a practical nature has been decided  no other question remains for adjustment  because all agree that under the constitution slavery in the states is beyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective states themselves wherein it exists  may we not  then  hope that the long agitation on this subject is approaching its end  and that the geographical parties to which it has given birth  so much dreaded by the father of his country  will speedily become extinct  most happy will it be for the country when the public mind shall be diverted from this question to others of more pressing and practical importance  throughout the whole progress of this agitation  which has scarcely known any intermission for more than twenty years  whilst it has been productive of no positive good to any human being it has been the prolific source of great evils to the master  to the slave  and to the whole country  it has alienated and estranged the people of the sister states from each other  and has even seriously endangered the very existence of the union  nor has the danger yet entirely ceased  under our system there is a remedy for all mere political evils in the sound sense and sober judgment of the people  time is a great corrective  political subjects which but a few years ago excited and exasperated the public mind have passed away and are now nearly forgotten  but this question of domestic slavery is of far graver importance than any mere political question  because should the agitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a large portion of our countrymen where the institution exists  in that event no form of government  however admirable in itself and however productive of material benefits  can compensate for the loss of peace and domestic security around the family altar  let every union loving man  therefore  exert his best influence to suppress this agitation  which since the recent legislation of congress is without any legitimate object   it is an evil omen of the times that men have undertaken to calculate the mere material value of the union  reasoned estimates have been presented of the pecuniary profits and local advantages which would result to different states and sections from its dissolution and of the comparative injuries which such an event would inflict on other states and sections  even descending to this low and narrow view of the mighty question  all such calculations are at fault  the bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusive on this point  we at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expanding country such as the world has never witnessed  this trade is conducted on railroads and canals  on noble rivers and arms of the sea  which bind together the north and the south  the east and the west  of our confederacy  annihilate this trade  arrest its free progress by the geographical lines of jealous and hostile states  and you destroy the prosperity and onward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one common ruin  but such considerations  important as they are in themselves  sink into insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evils which would result from disunion to every portion of the confederacy    to the north  not more than to the south  to the east not more than to the west  these i shall not attempt to portray  because i feel an humble confidence that the kind providence which inspired our fathers with wisdom to frame the most perfect form of government and union ever devised by man will not suffer it to perish until it shall have been peacefully instrumental by its example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world   next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the union is the duty of preserving the government free from the taint or even the suspicion of corruption  public virtue is the vital spirit of republics  and history proves that when this has decayed and the love of money has usurped its place  although the forms of free government may remain for a season  the substance has departed forever   our present financial condition is without a parallel in history  no nation has ever before been embarrassed from too large a surplus in its treasury  this almost necessarily gives birth to extravagant legislation  it produces wild schemes of expenditure and begets a race of speculators and jobbers  whose ingenuity is exerted in contriving and promoting expedients to obtain public money  the purity of official agents  whether rightfully or wrongfully  is suspected  and the character of the government suffers in the estimation of the people  this is in itself a very great evil   the natural mode of relief from this embarrassment is to appropriate the surplus in the treasury to great national objects for which a clear warrant can be found in the constitution  among these i might mention the extinguishment of the public debt  a reasonable increase of the navy  which is at present inadequate to the protection of our vast tonnage afloat  now greater than that of any other nation  as well as to the defense of our extended seacoast   it is beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought to be collected from the people than the amount necessary to defray the expenses of a wise  economical  and efficient administration of the government  to reach this point it was necessary to resort to a modification of the tariff  and this has  i trust  been accomplished in such a manner as to do as little injury as may have been practicable to our domestic manufactures  especially those necessary for the defense of the country  any discrimination against a particular branch for the purpose of benefiting favored corporations  individuals  or interests would have been unjust to the rest of the community and inconsistent with that spirit of fairness and equality which ought to govern in the adjustment of a revenue tariff   but the squandering of the public money sinks into comparative insignificance as a temptation to corruption when compared with the squandering of the public lands   no nation in the tide of time has ever been blessed with so rich and noble an inheritance as we enjoy in the public lands  in administering this important trust  whilst it may be wise to grant portions of them for the improvement of the remainder  yet we should never forget that it is our cardinal policy to reserve these lands  as much as may be  for actual settlers  and this at moderate prices  we shall thus not only best promote the prosperity of the new states and territories  by furnishing them a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizens  but shall secure homes for our children and our children s children  as well as for those exiles from foreign shores who may seek in this country to improve their condition and to enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty  such emigrants have done much to promote the growth and prosperity of the country  they have proved faithful both in peace and in war  after becoming citizens they are entitled  under the constitution and laws  to be placed on a perfect equality with native born citizens  and in this character they should ever be kindly recognized  the federal constitution is a grant from the states to congress of certain specific powers  and the question whether this grant should be liberally or strictly construed has more or less divided political parties from the beginning  without entering into the argument  i desire to state at the commencement of my administration that long experience and observation have convinced me that a strict construction of the powers of the government i the only true  as well as the only safe  theory of the constitution  whenever in our past history doubtful powers have been exercised by congress  these have never failed to produce injurious and unhappy consequences  many such instances might be adduced if this were the proper occasion  neither is it necessary for the public service to strain the language of the constitution  because all the great and useful powers required for a successful administration of the government  both in peace and in war  have been granted  either in express terms or by the plainest implication   whilst deeply convinced of these truths  i yet consider it clear that under the war making power congress may appropriate money toward the construction of a military road when this is absolutely necessary for the defense of any state or territory of the union against foreign invasion  under the constitution congress has power  to declare war    to raise and support armies    to provide and maintain a navy   and to call forth the militia to  repel invasions   thus endowed  in an ample manner  with the war making power  the corresponding duty is required that  the united states shall protect each of them  the states  against invasion   now  how is it possible to afford this protection to california and our pacific possessions except by means of a military road through the territories of the united states  over which men and munitions of war may be speedily transported from the atlantic states to meet and to repel the invader  in the event of a war with a naval power much stronger than our own we should then have no other available access to the pacific coast  because such a power would instantly close the route across the isthmus of central america  it is impossible to conceive that whilst the constitution has expressly required congress to defend all the states it should yet deny to them  by any fair construction  the only possible means by which one of these states can be defended  besides  the government  ever since its origin  has been in the constant practice of constructing military roads  it might also be wise to consider whether the love for the union which now animates our fellow citizens on the pacific coast may not be impaired by our neglect or refusal to provide for them  in their remote and isolated condition  the only means by which the power of the states on this side of the rocky mountains can reach them in sufficient time to  protect  them  against invasion   i forbear for the present from expressing an opinion as to the wisest and most economical mode in which the government can lend its aid in accomplishing this great and necessary work  i believe that many of the difficulties in the way  which now appear formidable  will in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route shall have been satisfactorily ascertained   it may be proper that on this occasion i should make some brief remarks in regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of nations  in our intercourse with them there are some plain principles  approved by our own experience  from which we should never depart  we ought to cultivate peace  commerce  and friendship with all nations  and this not merely as the best means of promoting our own material interests  but in a spirit of christian benevolence toward our fellow men  wherever their lot may be cast  our diplomacy should be direct and frank  neither seeking to obtain more nor accepting less than is our due  we ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of all nations  and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns of any unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of self preservation  to avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of our policy ever since the days of washington  and its wisdom s no one will attempt to dispute  in short  we ought to do justice in a kindly spirit to all nations and require justice from them in return   it is our glory that whilst other nations have extended their dominions by the sword we have never acquired any territory except by fair purchase or  as in the case of texas  by the voluntary determination of a brave  kindred  and independent people to blend their destinies with our own  even our acquisitions from mexico form no exception  unwilling to take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic  we purchased these possessions under the treaty of peace for a sum which was considered at the time a fair equivalent  our past history forbids that we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned by the laws of justice and honor  acting on this principle  no nation will have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of events we shall still further extend our possessions  hitherto in all our acquisitions the people  under the protection of the american flag  have enjoyed civil and religious liberty  as well as equal and just laws  and have been contented  prosperous  and happy  their trade with the rest of the world has rapidly increased  and thus every commercial nation has shared largely in their successful progress   i shall now proceed to take the oath prescribed by the constitution  whilst humbly invoking the blessing of divine providence on this great people     ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens of the united states  in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself  i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president  before he enters on the execution of this office    i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement   apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered  there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension  indeed  the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection  it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you  i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that      i have no purpose  directly or indirectly  to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists  i believe i have no lawful right to do so  and i have no inclination to do so   those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them  and more than this  they placed in the platform for my acceptance  and as a law to themselves and to me  the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read   resolved  that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states  and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively  is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend  and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory  no matter what pretext  as among the gravest of crimes   i now reiterate these sentiments  and in doing so i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property  peace  and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration  i add  too  that all the protection which  consistently with the constitution and the laws  can be given will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded  for whatever cause    as cheerfully to one section as to another   there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor  the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions   no person held to service or labor in one state  under the laws thereof  escaping into another  shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor  but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due   it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves  and the intention of the lawgiver is the law  all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution    to this provision as much as to any other  to the proposition  then  that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause  shall be delivered up  their oaths are unanimous  now  if they would make the effort in good temper  could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath   there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority  but surely that difference is not a very material one  if the slave is to be surrendered  it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done  and should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept   again  in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced  so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave  and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that  the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states    i take the official oath to day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules  and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced  i do suggest that it will be much safer for all  both in official and private stations  to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional   it is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution  during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the government  they have conducted it through many perils  and generally with great success  yet  with all this scope of precedent  i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty  a disruption of the federal union  heretofore only menaced  is now formidably attempted   i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual  perpetuity is implied  if not expressed  in the fundamental law of all national governments  it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination  continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution  and the union will endure forever  it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself   again  if the united states be not a government proper  but an association of states in the nature of contract merely  can it  as a contract  be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it  one party to a contract may violate it    break it  so to speak    but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it   descending from these general principles  we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself  the union is much older than the constitution  it was formed  in fact  by the articles of association in 1774  it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776  it was further matured  and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual  by the articles of confederation in 1778  and finally  in 1787  one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was  to form a more perfect union    but if destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible  the union is less perfect than before the constitution  having lost the vital element of perpetuity   it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union  that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void  and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary  according to circumstances   i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken  and to the extent of my ability  i shall take care  as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me  that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states  doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part  and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters  the american people  shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary  i trust this will not be regarded as a menace  but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself   in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence  and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority  the power confided to me will be used to hold  occupy  and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts  but beyond what may be necessary for these objects  there will be no invasion  no using of force against or among the people anywhere  where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices  there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object  while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices  the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices   the mails  unless repelled  will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union  so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection  the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper  and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised  according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections   that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny  but if there be such  i need address no word to them  to those  however  who really love the union may i not speak   before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric  with all its benefits  its memories  and its hopes  would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it  will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence  will you  while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from  will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake   all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained  is it true  then  that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied  i think not  happily  the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this  think  if you can  of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied  if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right  it might in a moral point of view justify revolution  certainly would if such right were a vital one  but such is not our case  all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations  guaranties and prohibitions  in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them  but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration  no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions  shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority  the constitution does not expressly say  may congress prohibit slavery in the territories  the constitution does not expressly say  must congress protect slavery in the territories  the constitution does not expressly say   from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies  and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities  if the minority will not acquiesce  the majority must  or the government must cease  there is no other alternative  for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other  if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce  they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them  for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority  for instance  why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again  precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it  all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this   is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession   plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy  a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations  and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments  is the only true sovereign of a free people  whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism  unanimity is impossible  the rule of a minority  as a permanent arrangement  is wholly inadmissible  so that  rejecting the majority principle  anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left   i do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court  nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit  while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government  and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case  still the evil effect following it  being limited to that particular case  with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases  can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice  at the same time  the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court  the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers  having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal  nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges  it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them  and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes   one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended  while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended  this is the only substantial dispute  the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced  perhaps  as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself  the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases  and a few break over in each  this  i think  can not be perfectly cured  and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before  the foreign slave trade  now imperfectly suppressed  would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section  while fugitive slaves  now only partially surrendered  would not be surrendered at all by the other   physically speaking  we can not separate  we can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them  a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other  but the different parts of our country can not do this  they can not but remain face to face  and intercourse  either amicable or hostile  must continue between them  is it possible  then  to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before  can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws  can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends  suppose you go to war  you can not fight always  and when  after much loss on both sides and no gain on either  you cease fighting  the identical old questions  as to terms of intercourse  are again upon you   this country  with its institutions  belongs to the people who inhabit it  whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government  they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it  i can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended  while i make no recommendation of amendments  i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject  to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself  and i should  under existing circumstances  favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it  i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable  in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves  instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others  not especially chosen for the purpose  and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse  i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution    which amendment  however  i have not seen  has passed congress  to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states  including that of persons held to service  to avoid misconstruction of what i have said  i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that  holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law  i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable   the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people  and they have referred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states  the people themselves can do this if also they choose  but the executive as such has nothing to do with it  his duty is to administer the present government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor   why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people  is there any better or equal hope in the world  in our present differences  is either party without faith of being in the right  if the almighty ruler of nations  with his eternal truth and justice  be on your side of the north  or on yours of the south  that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people   by the frame of the government under which we live this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief  and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals  while the people retain their virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years   my countrymen  one and all  think calmly and well upon this whole subject  nothing valuable can be lost by taking time  if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately  that object will be frustrated by taking time  but no good object can be frustrated by it  such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired  and  on the sensitive point  the laws of your own framing under it  while the new administration will have no immediate power  if it would  to change either  if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute  there still is no single good reason for precipitate action  intelligence  patriotism  christianity  and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty   in your hands  my dissatisfied fellow countrymen  and not in mine  is the momentous issue of civil war  the government will not assail you  you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors  you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government  while i shall have the most solemn one to  preserve  protect  and defend it    i am loath to close  we are not enemies  but friends  we must not be enemies  though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection  the mystic chords of memory  stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land  will yet swell the chorus of the union  when again touched  as surely they will be  by the better angels of our nature  ',\n",
       " 'fellow countrymen   at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first  then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper  now  at the expiration of four years  during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation  little that is new could be presented  the progress of our arms  upon which all else chiefly depends  is as well known to the public as to myself  and it is  i trust  reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all  with high hope for the future  no prediction in regard to it is ventured   on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war  all dreaded it all sought to avert it  while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place  devoted altogether to saving the union without war  urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war  seeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation  both parties deprecated war  but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive  and the other would accept war rather than let it perish  and the war came   one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves  not distributed generally over the union  but localized in the southern part of it  these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest  all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war  to strengthen  perpetuate  and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war  while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it  neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained  neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease  each looked for an easier triumph  and a result less fundamental and astounding  both read the same bible and pray to the same god  and each invokes his aid against the other  it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men s faces  but let us judge not  that we be not judged  the prayers of both could not be answered  that of neither has been answered fully  the almighty has his own purposes   woe unto the world because of offenses  for it must needs be that offenses come  but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh   if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which  in the providence of god  must needs come  but which  having continued through his appointed time  he now wills to remove  and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came  shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him  fondly do we hope  fervently do we pray  that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away  yet  if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk  and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword  as was said three thousand years ago  so still it must be said  the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether    with malice toward none  with charity for all  with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right  let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation s wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan  to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations  ',\n",
       " 'citizens of the united states   your suffrages having elected me to the office of president of the united states  i have  in conformity to the constitution of our country  taken the oath of office prescribed therein  i have taken this oath without mental reservation and with the determination to do to the best of my ability all that is required of me  the responsibilities of the position i feel  but accept them without fear  the office has come to me unsought  i commence its duties untrammeled  i bring to it a conscious desire and determination to fill it to the best of my ability to the satisfaction of the people   on all leading questions agitating the public mind i will always express my views to congress and urge them according to my judgment  and when i think it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of interposing a veto to defeat measures which i oppose  but all laws will be faithfully executed  whether they meet my approval or not   i shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend  but none to enforce against the will of the people  laws are to govern all alike    those opposed as well as those who favor them  i know no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution   the country having just emerged from a great rebellion  many questions will come before it for settlement in the next four years which preceding administrations have never had to deal with  in meeting these it is desirable that they should be approached calmly  without prejudice  hate  or sectional pride  remembering that the greatest good to the greatest number is the object to be attained   this requires security of person  property  and free religious and political opinion in every part of our common country  without regard to local prejudice  all laws to secure these ends will receive my best efforts for their enforcement   a great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity the union  the payment of this  principal and interest  as well as the return to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large  must be provided for  to protect the national honor  every dollar of government indebtedness should be paid in gold  unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract  let it be understood that no repudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in public place  and it will go far toward strengthening a credit which ought to be the best in the world  and will ultimately enable us to replace the debt with bonds bearing less interest than we now pay  to this should be added a faithful collection of the revenue  a strict accountability to the treasury for every dollar collected  and the greatest practicable retrenchment in expenditure in every department of government   when we compare the paying capacity of the country now  with the ten states in poverty from the effects of war  but soon to emerge  i trust  into greater prosperity than ever before  with its paying capacity twenty five years ago  and calculate what it probably will be twenty five years hence  who can doubt the feasibility of paying every dollar then with more ease than we now pay for useless luxuries  why  it looks as though providence had bestowed upon us a strong box in the precious metals locked up in the sterile mountains of the far west  and which we are now forging the key to unlock  to meet the very contingency that is now upon us   ultimately it may be necessary to insure the facilities to reach these riches and it may be necessary also that the general government should give its aid to secure this access  but that should only be when a dollar of obligation to pay secures precisely the same sort of dollar to use now  and not before  whilst the question of specie payments is in abeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts payable in the distant future  the nation should follow the same rule  a prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all industries encouraged   the young men of the country  those who from their age must be its rulers twenty five years hence  have a peculiar interest in maintaining the national honor  a moment s reflection as to what will be our commanding influence among the nations of the earth in their day  if they are only true to themselves  should inspire them with national pride  all divisions    geographical  political  and religious    can join in this common sentiment  how the public debt is to be paid or specie payments resumed is not so important as that a plan should be adopted and acquiesced in  a united determination to do is worth more than divided counsels upon the method of doing  legislation upon this subject may not be necessary now  or even advisable  but it will be when the civil law is more fully restored in all parts of the country and trade resumes its wonted channels   it will be my endeavor to execute all laws in good faith  to collect all revenues assessed  and to have them properly accounted for and economically disbursed  i will to the best of my ability appoint to office those only who will carry out this design   in regard to foreign policy  i would deal with nations as equitable law requires individuals to deal with each other  and i would protect the law abiding citizen  whether of native or foreign birth  wherever his rights are jeopardized or the flag of our country floats  i would respect the rights of all nations  demanding equal respect for our own  if others depart from this rule in their dealings with us  we may be compelled to follow their precedent   the proper treatment of the original occupants of this land    the indians one deserving of careful study  i will favor any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship   the question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate the public so long as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from its privileges in any state  it seems to me very desirable that this question should be settled now  and i entertain the hope and express the desire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of amendment to the constitution   in conclusion i ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout the land  and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his share toward cementing a happy union  and i ask the prayers of the nation to almighty god in behalf of this consummation  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens   under providence i have been called a second time to act as executive over this great nation  it has been my endeavor in the past to maintain all the laws  and  so far as lay in my power  to act for the best interests of the whole people  my best efforts will be given in the same direction in the future  aided  i trust  by my four years  experience in the office   when my first term of the office of chief executive began  the country had not recovered from the effects of a great internal revolution  and three of the former states of the union had not been restored to their federal relations   it seemed to me wise that no new questions should be raised so long as that condition of affairs existed  therefore the past four years  so far as i could control events  have been consumed in the effort to restore harmony  public credit  commerce  and all the arts of peace and progress  it is my firm conviction that the civilized world is tending toward republicanism  or government by the people through their chosen representatives  and that our own great republic is destined to be the guiding star to all others   under our republic we support an army less than that of any european power of any standing and a navy less than that of either of at least five of them  there could be no extension of territory on the continent which would call for an increase of this force  but rather might such extension enable us to diminish it   the theory of government changes with general progress  now that the telegraph is made available for communicating thought  together with rapid transit by steam  all parts of a continent are made contiguous for all purposes of government  and communication between the extreme limits of the country made easier than it was throughout the old thirteen states at the beginning of our national existence   the effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and make him a citizen  yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which citizenship should carry with it  this is wrong  and should be corrected  to this correction i stand committed  so far as executive influence can avail   social equality is not a subject to be legislated upon  nor shall i ask that anything be done to advance the social status of the colored man  except to give him a fair chance to develop what there is good in him  give him access to the schools  and when he travels let him feel assured that his conduct will regulate the treatment and fare he will receive   the states lately at war with the general government are now happily rehabilitated  and no executive control is exercised in any one of them that would not be exercised in any other state under like circumstances   in the first year of the past administration the proposition came up for the admission of santo domingo as a territory of the union  it was not a question of my seeking  but was a proposition from the people of santo domingo  and which i entertained  i believe now  as i did then  that it was for the best interest of this country  for the people of santo domingo  and all concerned that the proposition should be received favorably  it was  however  rejected constitutionally  and therefore the subject was never brought up again by me   in future  while i hold my present office  the subject of acquisition of territory must have the support of the people before i will recommend any proposition looking to such acquisition  i say here  however  that i do not share in the apprehension held by many as to the danger of governments becoming weakened and destroyed by reason of their extension of territory  commerce  education  and rapid transit of thought and matter by telegraph and steam have changed all this  rather do i believe that our great maker is preparing the world  in his own good time  to become one nation  speaking one language  and when armies and navies will be no longer required   my efforts in the future will be directed to the restoration of good feeling between the different sections of our common country  to the restoration of our currency to a fixed value as compared with the world s standard of values    gold    and  if possible  to a par with it  to the construction of cheap routes of transit throughout the land  to the end that the products of all may find a market and leave a living remuneration to the producer  to the maintenance of friendly relations with all our neighbors and with distant nations  to the reestablishment of our commerce and share in the carrying trade upon the ocean  to the encouragement of such manufacturing industries as can be economically pursued in this country  to the end that the exports of home products and industries may pay for our imports    the only sure method of returning to and permanently maintaining a specie basis  to the elevation of labor  and  by a humane course  to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization  it is either this or war of extermination  wars of extermination  engaged in by people pursuing commerce and all industrial pursuits  are expensive even against the weakest people  and are demoralizing and wicked  our superiority of strength and advantages of civilization should make us lenient toward the indian  the wrong inflicted upon him should be taken into account and the balance placed to his credit  the moral view of the question should be considered and the question asked  can not the indian be made a useful and productive member of society by proper teaching and treatment  if the effort is made in good faith  we will stand better before the civilized nations of the earth and in our own consciences for having made it   all these things are not to be accomplished by one individual  but they will receive my support and such recommendations to congress as will in my judgment best serve to carry them into effect  i beg your support and encouragement   it has been  and is  my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown up in the civil service of the country  to secure this reformation rules regulating methods of appointment and promotions were established and have been tried  my efforts for such reformation shall be continued to the best of my judgment  the spirit of the rules adopted will be maintained   i acknowledge before this assemblage  representing  as it does  every section of our country  the obligation i am under to my countrymen for the great honor they have conferred on me by returning me to the highest office within their gift  and the further obligation resting on me to render to them the best services within my power  this i promise  looking forward with the greatest anxiety to the day when i shall be released from responsibilities that at times are almost overwhelming  and from which i have scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing upon fort sumter  in april  1861  to the present day  my services were then tendered and accepted under the first call for troops growing out of that event   i did not ask for place or position  and was entirely without influence or the acquaintance of persons of influence  but was resolved to perform my part in a struggle threatening the very existence of the nation  i performed a conscientious duty  without asking promotion or command  and without a revengeful feeling toward any section or individual   notwithstanding this  throughout the war  and from my candidacy for my present office in 1868 to the close of the last presidential campaign  i have been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history  which to day i feel that i can afford to disregard in view of your verdict  which i gratefully accept as my vindication  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  we have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial  begun by washington  observed by all my predecessors  and now a time honored custom  which marks the commencement of a new term of the presidential office  called to the duties of this great trust  i proceed  in compliance with usage  to announce some of the leading principles  on the subjects that now chiefly engage the public attention  by which it is my desire to be guided in the discharge of those duties  i shall not undertake to lay down irrevocably principles or measures of administration  but rather to speak of the motives which should animate us  and to suggest certain important ends to be attained in accordance with our institutions and essential to the welfare of our country   at the outset of the discussions which preceded the recent presidential election it seemed to me fitting that i should fully make known my sentiments in regard to several of the important questions which then appeared to demand the consideration of the country  following the example  and in part adopting the language  of one of my predecessors  i wish now  when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away  to repeat what was said before the election  trusting that my countrymen will candidly weigh and understand it  and that they will feel assured that the sentiments declared in accepting the nomination for the presidency will be the standard of my conduct in the path before me  charged  as i now am  with the grave and difficult task of carrying them out in the practical administration of the government so far as depends  under the constitution and laws on the chief executive of the nation   the permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and by such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its citizens in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is now the one subject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and patriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance   many of the calamitous efforts of the tremendous revolution which has passed over the southern states still remain  the immeasurable benefits which will surely follow  sooner or later  the hearty and generous acceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have not yet been realized  difficult and embarrassing questions meet us at the threshold of this subject  the people of those states are still impoverished  and the inestimable blessing of wise  honest  and peaceful local self government is not fully enjoyed  whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of things  the fact is clear that in the progress of events the time has come when such government is the imperative necessity required by all the varied interests  public and private  of those states  but it must not be forgotten that only a local government which recognizes and maintains inviolate the rights of all is a true self government   with respect to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to each other have brought upon us the deplorable complications and perplexities which exist in those states  it must be a government which guards the interests of both races carefully and equally  it must be a government which submits loyally and heartily to the constitution and the laws    the laws of the nation and the laws of the states themselves  accepting and obeying faithfully the whole constitution as it is   resting upon this sure and substantial foundation  the superstructure of beneficent local governments can be built up  and not otherwise  in furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the constitution  and in behalf of all that its attainment implies  all so called party interests lose their apparent importance  and party lines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance  the question we have to consider for the immediate welfare of those states of the union is the question of government or no government  of social order and all the peaceful industries and the happiness that belongs to it  or a return to barbarism  it is a question in which every citizen of the nation is deeply interested  and with respect to which we ought not to be  in a partisan sense  either republicans or democrats  but fellow citizens and fellowmen  to whom the interests of a common country and a common humanity are dear   the sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion of our country and the advance of 4 000 000 people from a condition of servitude to that of citizenship  upon an equal footing with their former masters  could not occur without presenting problems of the gravest moment  to be dealt with by the emancipated race  by their former masters  and by the general government  the author of the act of emancipation  that it was a wise  just  and providential act  fraught with good for all concerned  is not generally conceded throughout the country  that a moral obligation rests upon the national government to employ its constitutional power and influence to establish the rights of the people it has emancipated  and to protect them in the enjoyment of those rights when they are infringed or assailed  is also generally admitted   the evils which afflict the southern states can only be removed or remedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races  actuated by motives of mutual sympathy and regard  and while in duty bound and fully determined to protect the rights of all by every constitutional means at the disposal of my administration  i am sincerely anxious to use every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient local self government as the true resource of those states for the promotion of the contentment and prosperity of their citizens  in the effort i shall make to accomplish this purpose i ask the cordial cooperation of all who cherish an interest in the welfare of the country  trusting that party ties and the prejudice of race will be freely surrendered in behalf of the great purpose to be accomplished  in the important work of restoring the south it is not the political situation alone that merits attention  the material development of that section of the country has been arrested by the social and political revolution through which it has passed  and now needs and deserves the considerate care of the national government within the just limits prescribed by the constitution and wise public economy   but at the basis of all prosperity  for that as well as for every other part of the country  lies the improvement of the intellectual and moral condition of the people  universal suffrage should rest upon universal education  to this end  liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the state governments  and  if need be  supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority   let me assure my countrymen of the southern states that it is my earnest desire to regard and promote their truest interest    the interests of the white and of the colored people both and equally    and to put forth my best efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will forever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the distinction between north and south  to the end that we may have not merely a united north or a united south  but a united country   i ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform in our civil service    a reform not merely as to certain abuses and practices of so called official patronage which have come to have the sanction of usage in the several departments of our government  but a change in the system of appointment itself  a reform that shall be thorough  radical  and complete  a return to the principles and practices of the founders of the government  they neither expected nor desired from public officers any partisan service  they meant that public officers should owe their whole service to the government and to the people  they meant that the officer should be secure in his tenure as long as his personal character remained untarnished and the performance of his duties satisfactory  they held that appointments to office were not to be made nor expected merely as rewards for partisan services  nor merely on the nomination of members of congress  as being entitled in any respect to the control of such appointments   the fact that both the great political parties of the country  in declaring their principles prior to the election  gave a prominent place to the subject of reform of our civil service  recognizing and strongly urging its necessity  in terms almost identical in their specific import with those i have here employed  must be accepted as a conclusive argument in behalf of these measures  it must be regarded as the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country upon this subject  and both political parties are virtually pledged to give it their unreserved support   the president of the united states of necessity owes his election to office to the suffrage and zealous labors of a political party  the members of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential importance the principles of their party organization  but he should strive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best who serves the country best   in furtherance of the reform we seek  and in other important respects a change of great importance  i recommend an amendment to the constitution prescribing a term of six years for the presidential office and forbidding a reelection   with respect to the financial condition of the country  i shall not attempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which we have suffered during the past three years  the depression in all our varied commercial and manufacturing interests throughout the country  which began in september  1873  still continues  it is very gratifying  however  to be able to say that there are indications all around us of a coming change to prosperous times   upon the currency question  intimately connected  as it is  with this topic  i may be permitted to repeat here the statement made in my letter of acceptance  that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty inseparable from an irredeemable paper currency  with its fluctuation of values  is one of the greatest obstacles to a return to prosperous times  the only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin basis and is at all times and promptly convertible into coin   i adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of congressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie payments  and i am satisfied not only that this is wise  but that the interests  as well as the public sentiment  of the country imperatively demand it   passing from these remarks upon the condition of our own country to consider our relations with other lands  we are reminded by the international complications abroad  threatening the peace of europe  that our traditional rule of noninterference in the affairs of foreign nations has proved of great value in past times and ought to be strictly observed   the policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor  president grant  of submitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves and foreign powers points to a new  and incomparably the best  instrumentality for the preservation of peace  and will  as i believe  become a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar emergencies by other nations   if  unhappily  questions of difference should at any time during the period of my administration arise between the united states and any foreign government  it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to aid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way  thus securing to our country the great blessings of peace and mutual good offices with all the nations of the world   fellow citizens  we have reached the close of a political contest marked by the excitement which usually attends the contests between great political parties whose members espouse and advocate with earnest faith their respective creeds  the circumstances were  perhaps  in no respect extraordinary save in the closeness and the consequent uncertainty of the result   for the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed best  in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case  that the objections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of the electoral votes should be referred to the decision of a tribunal appointed for this purpose   that tribunal    established by law for this sole purpose  its members  all of them  men of long established reputation for integrity and intelligence  and  with the exception of those who are also members of the supreme judiciary  chosen equally from both political parties  its deliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able counsel    was entitled to the fullest confidence of the american people  its decisions have been patiently waited for  and accepted as legally conclusive by the general judgment of the public  for the present  opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several conclusions announced by that tribunal  this is to be anticipated in every instance where matters of dispute are made the subject of arbitration under the forms of law  human judgment is never unerring  and is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest   the fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a dispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the law no less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the question in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing   upon one point there is entire unanimity in public sentiment    that conflicting claims to the presidency must be amicably and peaceably adjusted  and that when so adjusted the general acquiescence of the nation ought surely to follow   it has been reserved for a government of the people  where the right of suffrage is universal  to give to the world the first example in history of a great nation  in the midst of the struggle of opposing parties for power  hushing its party tumults to yield the issue of the contest to adjustment according to the forms of law   looking for the guidance of that divine hand by which the destinies of nations and individuals are shaped  i call upon you  senators  representatives  judges  fellow citizens  here and everywhere  to unite with me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the blessings  not only of material prosperity  but of justice  peace  and union  a union depending not upon the constraint of force  but upon the loving devotion of a free people   and that all things may be so ordered and settled upon the best and surest foundations that peace and happiness  truth and justice  religion and piety  may be established among us for all generations   ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens   we stand to day upon an eminence which overlooks a hundred years of national life    a century crowded with perils  but crowned with the triumphs of liberty and law  before continuing the onward march let us pause on this height for a moment to strengthen our faith and renew our hope by a glance at the pathway along which our people have traveled   it is now three days more than a hundred years since the adoption of the first written constitution of the united states    the articles of confederation and perpetual union  the new republic was then beset with danger on every hand  it had not conquered a place in the family of nations  the decisive battle of the war for independence  whose centennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrated at yorktown  had not yet been fought  the colonists were struggling not only against the armies of a great nation  but against the settled opinions of mankind  for the world did not then believe that the supreme authority of government could be safely intrusted to the guardianship of the people themselves   we can not overestimate the fervent love of liberty  the intelligent courage  and the sum of common sense with which our fathers made the great experiment of self government  when they found  after a short trial  that the confederacy of states  was too weak to meet the necessities of a vigorous and expanding republic  they boldly set it aside  and in its stead established a national union  founded directly upon the will of the people  endowed with full power of self preservation and ample authority for the accomplishment of its great object   under this constitution the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged  the foundations of order and peace have been strengthened  and the growth of our people in all the better elements of national life has indicated the wisdom of the founders and given new hope to their descendants  under this constitution our people long ago made themselves safe against danger from without and secured for their mariners and flag equality of rights on all the seas  under this constitution twenty five states have been added to the union  with constitutions and laws  framed and enforced by their own citizens  to secure the manifold blessings of local self government   the jurisdiction of this constitution now covers an area five times greater than that of the original thirteen states and a population twenty times greater than that of 1780   the supreme trial of the constitution came at last under the tremendous pressure of civil war  we ourselves are witnesses that the union emerged from the blood and fire of that conflict purified and made stronger for all the beneficent purposes of good government   and now  at the close of this first century of growth  with the inspirations of its history in their hearts  our people have lately reviewed the condition of the nation  passed judgment upon the conduct and opinions of political parties  and have registered their will concerning the future administration of the government  to interpret and to execute that will in accordance with the constitution is the paramount duty of the executive   even from this brief review it is manifest that the nation is resolutely facing to the front  resolved to employ its best energies in developing the great possibilities of the future  sacredly preserving whatever has been gained to liberty and good government during the century  our people are determined to leave behind them all those bitter controversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled  and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march   the supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject of debate  that discussion  which for half a century threatened the existence of the union  was closed at last in the high court of war by a decree from which there is no appeal    that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are and shall continue to be the supreme law of the land  binding alike upon the states and the people  this decree does not disturb the autonomy of the states nor interfere with any of their necessary rights of local self government  but it does fix and establish the permanent supremacy of the union   the will of the nation  speaking with the voice of battle and through the amended constitution  has fulfilled the great promise of 1776 by proclaiming  liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof    the elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the constitution of 1787  no thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people  it has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution  it has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people  it has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both  it has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5 000 000 people  and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness  it has given new inspiration to the power of self help in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other  the influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years   no doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our southern communities  this is to be deplored  though it was perhaps unavoidable  but those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship  there can be no permanent disfranchised peasantry in the united states  freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen   the emancipated race has already made remarkable progress  with unquestioning devotion to the union  with a patience and gentleness not born of fear  they have  followed the light as god gave them to see the light   they are rapidly laying the material foundations of self support  widening their circle of intelligence  and beginning to enjoy the blessings that gather around the homes of the industrious poor  they deserve the generous encouragement of all good men  so far as my authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the full and equal protection of the constitution and the laws   the free enjoyment of equal suffrage is still in question  and a frank statement of the issue may aid its solution  it is alleged that in many communities negro citizens are practically denied the freedom of the ballot  in so far as the truth of this allegation is admitted  it is answered that in many places honest local government is impossible if the mass of uneducated negroes are allowed to vote  these are grave allegations  so far as the latter is true  it is the only palliation that can be offered for opposing the freedom of the ballot  bad local government is certainly a great evil  which ought to be prevented  but to violate the freedom and sanctities of the suffrage is more than an evil  it is a crime which  if persisted in  will destroy the government itself  suicide is not a remedy  if in other lands it be high treason to compass the death of the king  it shall be counted no less a crime here to strangle our sovereign power and stifle its voice   it has been said that unsettled questions have no pity for the repose of nations  it should be said with the utmost emphasis that this question of the suffrage will never give repose or safety to the states or to the nation until each  within its own jurisdiction  makes and keeps the ballot free and pure by the strong sanctions of the law   but the danger which arises from ignorance in the voter can not be denied  it covers a field far wider than that of negro suffrage and the present condition of the race  it is a danger that lurks and hides in the sources and fountains of power in every state  we have no standard by which to measure the disaster that may be brought upon us by ignorance and vice in the citizens when joined to corruption and fraud in the suffrage   the voters of the union  who make and unmake constitutions  and upon whose will hang the destinies of our governments  can transmit their supreme authority to no successors save the coming generation of voters  who are the sole heirs of sovereign power  if that generation comes to its inheritance blinded by ignorance and corrupted by vice  the fall of the republic will be certain and remediless   the census has already sounded the alarm in the appalling figures which mark how dangerously high the tide of illiteracy has risen among our voters and their children   to the south this question is of supreme importance  but the responsibility for the existence of slavery did not rest upon the south alone  the nation itself is responsible for the extension of the suffrage  and is under special obligations to aid in removing the illiteracy which it has added to the voting population  for the north and south alike there is but one remedy  all the constitutional power of the nation and of the states and all the volunteer forces of the people should be surrendered to meet this danger by the savory influence of universal education   it is the high privilege and sacred duty of those now living to educate their successors and fit them  by intelligence and virtue  for the inheritance which awaits them   in this beneficent work sections and races should be forgotten and partisanship should be unknown  let our people find a new meaning in the divine oracle which declares that  a little child shall lead them   for our own little children will soon control the destinies of the republic   my countrymen  we do not now differ in our judgment concerning the controversies of past generations  and fifty years hence our children will not be divided in their opinions concerning our controversies  they will surely bless their fathers and their fathers  god that the union was preserved  that slavery was overthrown  and that both races were made equal before the law  we may hasten or we may retard  but we can not prevent  the final reconciliation  is it not possible for us now to make a truce with time by anticipating and accepting its inevitable verdict   enterprises of the highest importance to our moral and material well being unite us and offer ample employment of our best powers  let all our people  leaving behind them the battlefields of dead issues  move forward and in their strength of liberty and the restored union win the grander victories of peace   the prosperity which now prevails is without parallel in our history  fruitful seasons have done much to secure it  but they have not done all  the preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie payments  so successfully attained by the administration of my predecessors  have enabled our people to secure the blessings which the seasons brought   by the experience of commercial nations in all ages it has been found that gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary system  confusion has recently been created by variations in the relative value of the two metals  but i confidently believe that arrangements can be made between the leading commercial nations which will secure the general use of both metals  congress should provide that the compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our monetary system by driving either metal of circulation  if possible  such an adjustment should be made that the purchasing power of every coined dollar will be exactly equal to its debt paying power in all the markets of the world   the chief duty of the national government in connection with the currency of the country is to coin money and declare its value  grave doubts have been entertained whether congress is authorized by the constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender  the present issue of united states notes has been sustained by the necessities of war  but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the holder  and not upon its compulsory circulation  these notes are not money  but promises to pay money  if the holders demand it  the promise should be kept   the refunding of the national debt at a lower rate of interest should be accomplished without compelling the withdrawal of the national bank notes  and thus disturbing the business of the country   i venture to refer to the position i have occupied on financial questions during a long service in congress  and to say that time and experience have strengthened the opinions i have so often expressed on these subjects   the finances of the government shall suffer no detriment which it may be possible for my administration to prevent   the interests of agriculture deserve more attention from the government than they have yet received  the farms of the united states afford homes and employment for more than one half our people  and furnish much the largest part of all our exports  as the government lights our coasts for the protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce  so it should give to the tillers of the soil the best lights of practical science and experience   our manufacturers are rapidly making us industrially independent  and are opening to capital and labor new and profitable fields of employment  their steady and healthy growth should still be matured  our facilities for transportation should be promoted by the continued improvement of our harbors and great interior waterways and by the increase of our tonnage on the ocean   the development of the world s commerce has led to an urgent demand for shortening the great sea voyage around cape horn by constructing ship canals or railways across the isthmus which unites the continents  various plans to this end have been suggested and will need consideration  but none of them has been sufficiently matured to warrant the united states in extending pecuniary aid  the subject  however  is one which will immediately engage the attention of the government with a view to a thorough protection to american interests  we will urge no narrow policy nor seek peculiar or exclusive privileges in any commercial route  but  in the language of my predecessor  i believe it to be the right  and duty of the united states to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects north and south america as will protect our national interest    the constitution guarantees absolute religious freedom  congress is prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof  the territories of the united states are subject to the direct legislative authority of congress  and hence the general government is responsible for any violation of the constitution in any of them  it is therefore a reproach to the government that in the most populous of the territories the constitutional guaranty is not enjoyed by the people and the authority of congress is set at naught  the mormon church not only offends the moral sense of manhood by sanctioning polygamy  but prevents the administration of justice through ordinary instrumentalities of law   in my judgment it is the duty of congress  while respecting to the uttermost the conscientious convictions and religious scruples of every citizen  to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practices  especially of that class which destroy the family relations and endanger social order  nor can any ecclesiastical organization be safely permitted to usurp in the smallest degree the functions and powers of the national government   the civil service can never be placed on a satisfactory basis until it is regulated by law  for the good of the service itself  for the protection of those who are intrusted with the appointing power against the waste of time and obstruction to the public business caused by the inordinate pressure for place  and for the protection of incumbents against intrigue and wrong  i shall at the proper time ask congress to fix the tenure of the minor offices of the several executive departments and prescribe the grounds upon which removals shall be made during the terms for which incumbents have been appointed   finally  acting always within the authority and limitations of the constitution  invading neither the rights of the states nor the reserved rights of the people  it will be the purpose of my administration to maintain the authority of the nation in all places within its jurisdiction  to enforce obedience to all the laws of the union in the interests of the people  to demand rigid economy in all the expenditures of the government  and to require the honest and faithful service of all executive officers  remembering that the offices were created  not for the benefit of incumbents or their supporters  but for the service of the government   and now  fellow citizens  i am about to assume the great trust which you have committed to my hands  i appeal to you for that earnest and thoughtful support which makes this government in fact  as it is in law  a government of the people   i shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of congress and of those who may share with me the responsibilities and duties of administration  and  above all  upon our efforts to promote the welfare of this great people and their government i reverently invoke the support and blessings of almighty god  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  in the presence of this vast assemblage of my countrymen i am about to supplement and seal by the oath which i shall take the manifestation of the will of a great and free people  in the exercise of their power and right of self government they have committed to one of their fellow citizens a supreme and sacred trust  and he here consecrates himself to their service   this impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of responsibility with which i contemplate the duty i owe to all the people of the land  nothing can relieve me from anxiety lest by any act of mine their interests may suffer  and nothing is needed to strengthen my resolution to engage every faculty and effort in the promotion of their welfare   amid the din of party strife the people s choice was made  but its attendant circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety of a government by the people  in each succeeding year it more clearly appears that our democratic principle needs no apology  and that in its fearless and faithful application is to be found the surest guaranty of good government   but the best results in the operation of a government wherein every citizen has a share largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely partisan zeal and effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the heat of the partisan should be merged in the patriotism of the citizen   today the executive branch of the government is transferred to new keeping  but this is still the government of all the people  and it should be none the less an object of their affectionate solicitude  at this hour the animosities of political strife  the bitterness of partisan defeat  and the exultation of partisan triumph should be supplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular will and a sober  conscientious concern for the general weal  moreover  if from this hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and distrust  and determine  with manly confidence in one another  to work out harmoniously the achievements of our national destiny  we shall deserve to realize all the benefits which our happy form of government can bestow   on this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion to the constitution  which  launched by the founders of the republic and consecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion  has for almost a century borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through prosperity and peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the perils of domestic strife and vicissitudes   by the father of his country our constitution was commended for adoption as  the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession   in that same spirit it should be administered  in order to promote the lasting welfare of the country and to secure the full measure of its priceless benefits to us and to those who will succeed to the blessings of our national life  the large variety of diverse and competing interests subject to federal control  persistently seeking the recognition of their claims  need give us no fear that  the greatest good to the greatest number  will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of national legislation that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall prevail in which the constitution had its birth  if this involves the surrender or postponement of private interests and the abandonment of local advantages  compensation will be found in the assurance that the common interest is subserved and the general welfare advanced   in the discharge of my official duty i shall endeavor to be guided by a just and unstrained construction of the constitution  a careful observance of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people  and by a cautious appreciation of those functions which by the constitution and laws have been especially assigned to the executive branch of the government   but he who takes the oath today to preserve  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states only assumes the solemn obligation which every patriotic citizen    on the farm  in the workshop  in the busy marts of trade  and everywhere    should share with him  the constitution which prescribes his oath  my countrymen  is yours  the government you have chosen him to administer for a time is yours  the suffrage which executes the will of freemen is yours  the laws and the entire scheme of our civil rule  from the town meeting to the state capitals and the national capital  is yours  your every voter  as surely as your chief magistrate  under the same high sanction  though in a different sphere  exercises a public trust  nor is this all  every citizen owes to the country a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and a fair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness  thus is the people s will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil polity  municipal  state  and federal  and this is the price of our liberty and the inspiration of our faith in the republic   it is the duty of those serving the people in public place to closely limit public expenditures to the actual needs of the government economically administered  because this bounds the right of the government to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen  and because public extravagance begets extravagance among the people  we should never be ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the mission of the american people  those who are selected for a limited time to manage public affairs are still of the people  and may do much by their example to encourage  consistently with the dignity of their official functions  that plain way of life which among their fellow citizens aids integrity and promotes thrift and prosperity   the genius of our institutions  the needs of our people in their home life  and the attention which is demanded for the settlement and development of the resources of our vast territory dictate the scrupulous avoidance of any departure from that foreign policy commended by the history  the traditions  and the prosperity of our republic  it is the policy of independence  favored by our position and defended by our known love of justice and by our power  it is the policy of peace suitable to our interests  it is the policy of neutrality  rejecting any share in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and repelling their intrusion here  it is the policy of monroe and of washington and jefferson     peace  commerce  and honest friendship with all nations  entangling alliance with none    a due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands that our finances shall be established upon such a sound and sensible basis as shall secure the safety and confidence of business interests and make the wage of labor sure and steady  and that our system of revenue shall be so adjusted as to relieve the people of unnecessary taxation  having a due regard to the interests of capital invested and workingmen employed in american industries  and preventing the accumulation of a surplus in the treasury to tempt extravagance and waste   care for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers requires that the public domain should be protected from purloining schemes and unlawful occupation   the conscience of the people demands that the indians within our boundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the government and their education and civilization promoted with a view to their ultimate citizenship  and that polygamy in the territories  destructive of the family relation and offensive to the moral sense of the civilized world  shall be repressed   the laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of a servile class to compete with american labor  with no intention of acquiring citizenship  and bringing with them and retaining habits and customs repugnant to our civilization   the people demand reform in the administration of the government and the application of business principles to public affairs  as a means to this end  civil service reform should be in good faith enforced  our citizens have the right to protection from the incompetency of public employees who hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service  and from the corrupting influence of those who promise and the vicious methods of those who expect such rewards  and those who worthily seek public employment have the right to insist that merit and competency shall be recognized instead of party subserviency or the surrender of honest political belief   in the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact justice to all men there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the protection of the freedmen in their rights or their security in the enjoyment of their privileges under the constitution and its amendments  all discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as american citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the necessity for their improvement  the fact that they are citizens entitles them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them with all its duties  obligations  and responsibilities   these topics and the constant and ever varying wants of an active and enterprising population may well receive the attention and the patriotic endeavor of all who make and execute the federal law  our duties are practical and call for industrious application  an intelligent perception of the claims of public office  and  above all  a firm determination  by united action  to secure to all the people of the land the full benefits of the best form of government ever vouchsafed to man  and let us not trust to human effort alone  but humbly acknowledging the power and goodness of almighty god  who presides over the destiny of nations  and who has at all times been revealed in our country s history  let us invoke his aid and his blessings upon our labors  ',\n",
       " 'fellow citizens  there is no constitutional or legal requirement that the president shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people  but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the government the people  to whose service the official oath consecrates the officer  have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial  the oath taken in the presence of the people becomes a mutual covenant  the officer covenants to serve the whole body of the people by a faithful execution of the laws  so that they may be the unfailing defense and security of those who respect and observe them  and that neither wealth  station  nor the power of combinations shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest them from a beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness   my promise is spoken  yours unspoken  but not the less real and solemn  the people of every state have here their representatives  surely i do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when i assume that the whole body of the people covenant with me and with each other to day to support and defend the constitution and the union of the states  to yield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen his equal civil and political rights  entering thus solemnly into covenant with each other  we may reverently invoke and confidently expect the favor and help of almighty god    that he will give to me wisdom  strength  and fidelity  and to our people a spirit of fraternity and a love of righteousness and peace   this occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the presidential term which begins this day is the twenty sixth under our constitution  the first inauguration of president washington took place in new york  where congress was then sitting  on the 30th day of april  1789  having been deferred by reason of delays attending the organization of the congress and the canvass of the electoral vote  our people have already worthily observed the centennials of the declaration of independence  of the battle of yorktown  and of the adoption of the constitution  and will shortly celebrate in new york the institution of the second great department of our constitutional scheme of government  when the centennial of the institution of the judicial department  by the organization of the supreme court  shall have been suitably observed  as i trust it will be  our nation will have full entered its second century   i will not attempt to note the marvelous and in great part happy contrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its second century of organized existence under the constitution and that weak but wisely ordered young nation that looked undauntedly down the first century  when all its years stretched out before it   our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which accompanied the institution of government under the constitution  or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of washington and his great associates  and hope and courage in the contrast which thirty eight populous and prosperous states offer to the thirteen states  weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty  that then fringed our atlantic seaboard   the territory of dakota has now a population greater than any of the original states  except virginia  and greater than the aggregate of five of the smaller states in 1790  the center of population when our national capital was located was east of baltimore  and it was argued by many well informed persons that it would move eastward rather than westward  yet in 1880 it was found to be near cincinnati  and the new census about to be taken will show another stride to the westward  that which was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation s robe  but our growth has not been limited to territory  population and aggregate wealth  marvelous as it has been in each of those directions  the masses of our people are better fed  clothed  and housed than their fathers were  the facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused   the virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people  the influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened  the sweet offices of charity have greatly increased  the virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation  we have not attained an ideal condition  not all of our people are happy and prosperous  not all of them are virtuous and law abiding  but on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago   the surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the general government  effected by the adoption of the constitution  was not accomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly reenforced by the more imperative voice of experience  the divergent interests of peace speedily demanded a  more perfect union   the merchant  the shipmaster  and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our statesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be added to the political freedom which had been so bravely won  the commercial policy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and oppressive features  to hold in check the development of our commercial marine  to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of manufactures in the states  and so to secure the american market for their shops and the carrying trade for their ships  was the policy of european statesmen  and was pursued with the most selfish vigor   petitions poured in upon congress urging the imposition of discriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed things at home  the patriotism of the people  which no longer found afield of exercise in war  was energetically directed to the duty of equipping the young republic for the defense of its independence by making its people self dependent  societies for the promotion of home manufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of the people were organized in many of the states  the revival at the end of the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation and development of domestic industries and the defense of our working people against injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of attention  it is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed  the protective policy had then its opponents  the argument was made  as now  that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections   if the question became in any sense or at any time sectional  it was only because slavery existed in some of the states  but for this there was no reason why the cotton producing states should not have led or walked abreast with the new england states in the production of cotton fabrics  there was this reason only why the states that divide with pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and central mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near opposing hillsides  mill fires were lighted at the funeral pile of slavery  the emancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the earth as well as in the sky  men were made free  and material things became our better servants   the sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff discussion  we have no longer states that are necessarily only planting states  none are excluded from achieving that diversification of pursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment  the cotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is spun in the country town by operatives whose necessities call for diversified crops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural products  every new mine  furnace  and factory is an extension of the productive capacity of the state more real and valuable than added territory   shall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang upon the skirts of progress  how long will those who rejoice that slavery no longer exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it put upon their communities  i look hopefully to the continuance of our protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining enterprises in the states hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification of our people  the men who have invested their capital in these enterprises  the farmers who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood  and the men who work in shop or field will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest   is it not quite possible that the farmers and the promoters of the great mining and manufacturing enterprises which have recently been established in the south may yet find that the free ballot of the workingman  without distinction of race  is needed for their defense as well as for his own  i do not doubt that if those men in the south who now accept the tariff views of clay and the constitutional expositions of webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions they would not find it difficult  by friendly instruction and cooperation  to make the black man their efficient and safe ally  not only in establishing correct principles in our national administration  but in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social order and economical and honest government  at least until the good offices of kindness and education have been fairly tried the contrary conclusion can not be plausibly urged   i have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special executive policy for any section of our country  it is the duty of the executive to administer and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities pointed out and provided by the constitution all the laws enacted by congress  these laws are general and their administration should be uniform and equal  as a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey  neither may the executive eject which he will enforce  the duty to obey and to execute embraces the constitution in its entirety and the whole code of laws enacted under it  the evil example of permitting individuals  corporations  or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of danger  not only to the nation at large  but much more to those who use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain an unjust advantage over others  they will presently themselves be compelled to appeal to the law for protection  and those who would use the law as a defense must not deny that use of it to others   if our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal limitations and duties  they would have less cause to complain of the unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference with their operations  the community that by concert  open or secret  among its citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain rights under the law has severed the only safe bond of social order and prosperity  the evil works from a bad center both ways  it demoralizes those who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector  the man in whose breast that faith has been darkened is naturally the subject of dangerous and uncanny suggestions  those who use unlawful methods  if moved by no higher motive than the selfishness that prompted them  may well stop and inquire what is to be the end of this   an unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of government  if the educated and influential classes in a community either practice or connive at the systematic violation of laws that seem to them to cross their convenience  what can they expect when the lesson that convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for lawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes  a community where law is the rule of conduct and where courts  not mobs  execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business investments and honest labor   our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry into the character and good disposition of persons applying for citizenship more careful and searching  our existing laws have been in their administration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form  we accept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness  and he assumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to what they are  the privileges of american citizenship are so great and its duties so grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of every person applying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of our institutions  we should not cease to be hospitable to immigration  but we should cease to be careless as to the character of it  there are men of all races  even the best  whose coming is necessarily a burden upon our public revenues or a threat to social order  these should be identified and excluded   we have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with european affairs  we have been only interested spectators of their contentions in diplomacy and in war  ready to use our friendly offices to promote peace  but never obtruding our advice and never attempting unfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into commercial advantage to ourselves  we have a just right to expect that our european policy will be the american policy of european courts   it is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our peace and safety which all the great powers habitually observe and enforce in matters affecting them that a shorter waterway between our eastern and western seaboards should be dominated by any european government that we may confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertained by any friendly power   we shall in the future  as in the past  use every endeavor to maintain and enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers  but they will not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would leave us subject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment  we have not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker neighbors  but rather to aid and encourage them to establish free and stable governments resting upon the consent of their own people  we have a clear right to expect  therefore  that no european government will seek to establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of these independent american states  that which a sense of justice restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego   it must not be assumed  however  that our interests are so exclusively american that our entire inattention to any events that may transpire elsewhere can be taken for granted  our citizens domiciled for purposes of trade in all countries and in many of the islands of the sea demand and will have our adequate care in their personal and commercial rights  the necessities of our navy require convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges  these and other trading privileges we will feel free to obtain only by means that do not in any degree partake of coercion  however feeble the government from which we ask such concessions  but having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other powers  our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment of the concession   we shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or the just rights of its citizens  nor to exact the like treatment for our own  calmness  justice  and consideration should characterize our diplomacy  the offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly arbitration in proper cases should be adequate to the peaceful adjustment of all international difficulties  by such methods we will make our contribution to the world s peace  which no nation values more highly  and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation that ruthlessly breaks it   the duty devolved by law upon the president to nominate and  by and with the advice and consent of the senate  to appoint all public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the constitution or by act of congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty  the civil list is so large that a personal knowledge of any large number of the applicants is impossible  the president must rely upon the representations of others  and these are often made inconsiderately and without any just sense of responsibility  i have a right  i think  to insist that those who volunteer or are invited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration and fidelity  a high sense of duty and an ambition to improve the service should characterize all public officers   there are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who have business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful and obliging officer  and i shall expect those whom i may appoint to justify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their duties  honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed by me a disqualification for public office  but it will in no case be allowed to serve as a shield of official negligence  incompetency  or delinquency  it is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper methods and with proper motives  and all applicants will be treated with consideration  but i shall need  and the heads of departments will need  time for inquiry and deliberation  persistent importunity will not  therefore  be the best support of an application for office  heads of departments  bureaus  and all other public officers having any duty connected therewith will be expected to enforce the civil service law fully and without evasion  beyond this obvious duty i hope to do something more to advance the reform of the civil service  the ideal  or even my own ideal  i shall probably not attain  retrospect will be a safer basis of judgment than promises  we shall not  however  i am sure  be able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until we have secured an incumbency that fair minded men of the opposition will approve for impartiality and integrity  as the number of such in the civil list is increased removals from office will diminish   while a treasury surplus is not the greatest evil  it is a serious evil  our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands upon our treasury  with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but scarcely less imperative demands which arise now and then  expenditure should always be made with economy and only upon public necessity  wastefulness  profligacy  or favoritism in public expenditures is criminal  but there is nothing in the condition of our country or of our people to suggest that anything presently necessary to the public prosperity  security  or honor should be unduly postponed   it will be the duty of congress wisely to forecast and estimate these extraordinary demands  and  having added them to our ordinary expenditures  to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual surplus will remain  we will fortunately be able to apply to the redemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen excess of revenue  this is better than to reduce our income below our necessary expenditures  with the resulting choice between another change of our revenue laws and an increase of the public debt  it is quite possible  i am sure  to effect the necessary reduction in our revenues without breaking down our protective tariff or seriously injuring any domestic industry   the construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of their necessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection in plans and workmanship  the spirit  courage  and skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times in our history given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly beyond that of the naval list  that they will again do so upon occasion i do not doubt  but they ought not  by premeditation or neglect  to be left to the risks and exigencies of an unequal combat  we should encourage the establishment of american steamship lines  the exchanges of commerce demand stated  reliable  and rapid means of communication  and until these are provided the development of our trade with the states lying south of us is impossible   our pension laws should give more adequate and discriminating relief to the union soldiers and sailors and to their widows and orphans  such occasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to their valor and sacrifice   it is a subject of congratulation that there is a near prospect of the admission into the union of the dakotas and montana and washington territories  this act of justice has been unreasonably delayed in the case of some of them  the people who have settled these territories are intelligent  enterprising  and patriotic  and the accession these new states will add strength to the nation  it is due to the settlers in the territories who have availed themselves of the invitations of our land laws to make homes upon the public domain that their titles should be speedily adjusted and their honest entries confirmed by patent   it is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being manifested in the reform of our election laws  those who have been for years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the ballot box and about the elector further safeguards  in order that our elections might not only be free and pure  but might clearly appear to be so  will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover the need of reform  the national congress has not as yet taken control of elections in that case over which the constitution gives it jurisdiction  but has accepted and adopted the election laws of the several states  provided penalties for their violation and a method of supervision  only the inefficiency of the state laws or an unfair partisan administration of them could suggest a departure from this policy   it was clearly  however  in the contemplation of the framers of the constitution that such an exigency might arise  and provision was wisely made for it  the freedom of the ballot is a condition of our national life  and no power vested in congress or in the executive to secure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion  the people of all the congressional districts have an equal interest that the election in each shall truly express the views and wishes of a majority of the qualified electors residing within it  the results of such elections are not local  and the insistence of electors residing in other districts that they shall be pure and free does not savor at all of impertinence   if in any of the states the public security is thought to be threatened by ignorance among the electors  the obvious remedy is education  the sympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community struggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with the suffrage if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are promoted by just and honorable methods  how shall those who practice election frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship  the man who has come to regard the ballot box as a juggler s hat has renounced his allegiance   let us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions  let those who would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better proof of their patriotism and a higher glory to their country by promoting fraternity and justice  a party success that is achieved by unfair methods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and evanescent even from a party standpoint  we should hold our differing opinions in mutual respect  and  having submitted them to the arbitrament of the ballot  should accept an adverse judgment with the same respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the decision had been in our favor   no other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love or a land so magnificent in extent  so pleasant to look upon  and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor  god has placed upon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond definition or calculation  but we must not forget that we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the people   i do not mistrust the future  dangers have been in frequent ambush along our path  but we have uncovered and vanquished them all  passion has swept some of our communities  but only to give us a new demonstration that the great body of our people are stable  patriotic  and law abiding  no political party can long pursue advantage at the expense of public honor or by rude and indecent methods without protest and fatal disaffection in its own body  the peaceful agencies of commerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our communities  and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual respect  we shall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation which our next census will make of the swift development of the great resources of some of the states  each state will bring its generous contribution to the great aggregate of the nation s increase  and when the harvests from the fields  the cattle from the hills  and the ores of the earth shall have been weighed  counted  and valued  we will turn from them all to crown with the highest honor the state that has most promoted education  virtue  justice  and patriotism among its people  ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens  in obedience of the mandate of my countrymen i am about to dedicate myself to their service under the sanction of a solemn oath  deeply moved by the expression of confidence and personal attachment which has called me to this service  i am sure my gratitude can make no better return than the pledge i now give before god and these witnesses of unreserved and complete devotion to the interests and welfare of those who have honored me   i deem it fitting on this occasion  while indicating the opinion i hold concerning public questions of present importance  to also briefly refer to the existence of certain conditions and tendencies among our people which seem to menace the integrity and usefulness of their government   while every american citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and enthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country  the sufficiency of our institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence  the wonderful thrift and enterprise of our people  and the demonstrated superiority of our free government  it behooves us to constantly watch for every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national vigor   the strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health courts the sternest activities of life and rejoices in the hardihood of constant labor may still have lurking near his vitals the unheeded disease that dooms him to sudden collapse   it can not be doubted that our stupendous achievements as a people and our country s robust strength have given rise to heedlessness of those laws governing our national health which we can no more evade than human life can escape the laws of god and nature   manifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the beneficent purposes of our government than a sound and stable currency  its exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the most enlightened statesmanship  and the danger of depreciation in the purchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the strongest incentive to prompt and conservative precaution   in dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this subject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our national strength and resources with the frank concession that even these will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws of finance and trade  at the same time  in our efforts to adjust differences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion  and our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by selfish interests   i am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in prudent and effective remedial legislation  in the meantime  so far as the executive branch of the government can intervene  none of the powers with which it is invested will be withheld when their exercise is deemed necessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial disaster   closely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country s greatness which tends to a disregard of the rules of national safety  another danger confronts us not less serious  i refer to the prevalence of a popular disposition to expect from the operation of the government especial and direct individual advantages   the verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining protection for protection s sake enjoins upon the people s servants the duty of exposing and destroying the brood of kindred evils which are the unwholesome progeny of paternalism  this is the bane of republican institutions and the constant peril of our government by the people  it degrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers established and bequeathed to us as an object of our love and veneration  it perverts the patriotic sentiments of our countrymen and tempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain to be derived from their government s maintenance  it undermines the self reliance of our people and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental favoritism  it stifles the spirit of true americanism and stupefies every ennobling trait of american citizenship   the lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson taught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully support their government its functions do not include the support of the people   the acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and subsidies  which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our citizens to aid ill advised or languishing enterprises in which they have no concern  it leads also to a challenge of wild and reckless pension expenditure  which overleaps the bounds of grateful recognition of patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the people s prompt and generous impulse to aid those disabled in their country s defense   every thoughtful american must realize the importance of checking at its beginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality and economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow  the toleration of this idea results in the waste of the people s money by their chosen servants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home life of our countrymen   under our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime against the citizen  and the contempt of our people for economy and frugality in their personal affairs deplorably saps the strength and sturdiness of our national character   it is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public expenditures should be limited by public necessity  and that this should be measured by the rules of strict economy  and it is equally clear that frugality among the people is the best guaranty of a contented and strong support of free institutions   one mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when appointments to office  instead of being the rewards of partisan activity  are awarded to those whose efficiency promises a fair return of work for the compensation paid to them  to secure the fitness and competency of appointees to office and remove from political action the demoralizing madness for spoils  civil service reform has found a place in our public policy and laws  the benefits already gained through this instrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public service well performed or who hope for the elevation of political sentiment and the purification of political methods   the existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and combinations of business interests formed for the purpose of limiting production and fixing prices is inconsistent with the fair field which ought to be open to every independent activity  legitimate strife in business should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the demands of combinations that have the power to destroy  nor should the people to be served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results from wholesome competition  these aggregations and combinations frequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people  and in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our american sense of fairness  to the extent that they can be reached and restrained by federal power the general government should relieve our citizens from their interference and exactions   loyalty to the principles upon which our government rests positively demands that the equality before the law which it guarantees to every citizen should be justly and in good faith conceded in all parts of the land  the enjoyment of this right follows the badge of citizenship wherever found  and  unimpaired by race or color  it appeals for recognition to american manliness and fairness   our relations with the indians located within our border impose upon us responsibilities we can not escape  humanity and consistency require us to treat them with forbearance and in our dealings with them to honestly and considerately regard their rights and interests  every effort should be made to lead them  through the paths of civilization and education  to self supporting and independent citizenship  in the meantime  as the nation s wards  they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of designing men and shielded from every influence or temptation that retards their advancement   the people of the united states have decreed that on this day the control of their government in its legislative and executive branches shall be given to a political party pledged in the most positive terms to the accomplishment of tariff reform  they have thus determined in favor of a more just and equitable system of federal taxation  the agents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their promises not less than by the command of their masters to devote themselves unremittingly to this service   while there should be no surrender of principle  our task must be undertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness  our mission is not punishment  but the rectification of wrong  if in lifting burdens from the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal advantages too long enjoyed  this is but a necessary incident of our return to right and justice  if we exact from unwilling minds acquiescence in the theory of an honest distribution of the fund of the governmental beneficence treasured up for all  we but insist upon a principle which underlies our free institutions  when we tear aside the delusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their condition under vicious tariff laws  we but show them how far they have been led away from the paths of contentment and prosperity  when we proclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the government furnishes the only justification for taxing the people  we announce a truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the taxing power  and when we seek to reinstate the self confidence and business enterprise of our citizens by discrediting an abject dependence upon governmental favor  we strive to stimulate those elements of american character which support the hope of american achievement   anxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and solicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people have reposed in us constrain me to remind those with whom i am to cooperate that we can succeed in doing the work which has been especially set before us only by the most sincere  harmonious  and disinterested effort  even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the consummation of our task  we shall hardly be excused  and if failure can be traced to our fault or neglect we may be sure the people will hold us to a swift and exacting accountability   the oath i now take to preserve  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states not only impressively defines the great responsibility i assume  but suggests obedience to constitutional commands as the rule by which my official conduct must be guided  i shall to the best of my ability and within my sphere of duty preserve the constitution by loyally protecting every grant of federal power it contains  by defending all its restraints when attacked by impatience and restlessness  and by enforcing its limitations and reservations in favor of the states and the people   fully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and mindful of my weakness  i should be appalled if it were my lot to bear unaided the responsibilities which await me  i am  however  saved from discouragement when i remember that i shall have the support and the counsel and cooperation of wise and patriotic men who will stand at my side in cabinet places or will represent the people in their legislative halls   i find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and generous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those who by sincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and approval   above all  i know there is a supreme being who rules the affairs of men and whose goodness and mercy have always followed the american people  and i know he will not turn from us now if we humbly and reverently seek his powerful aid  ',\n",

our paper money offer  in my judgment  a constant embarrassment to the government and a safe balance in the treasury  therefore i believe it necessary to devise a system which  without diminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its contraction  will present a remedy for those arrangements which  temporary in their nature  might well in the years of our prosperity have been displaced by wiser provisions  with adequate revenue secured  but not until then  we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as will  while insuring safety and volume to our money  no longer impose upon the government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold reserve  with its attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation  most of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial  and should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes  we must be both  sure we are right  and  make haste slowly   if  therefore  congress  in its wisdom  shall deem it expedient to create a commission to take under early consideration the revision of our coinage  banking and currency laws  and give them that exhaustive  careful and dispassionate examination that their importance demands  i shall cordially concur in such action  if such power is vested in the president  it is my purpose to appoint a commission of prominent  well informed citizens of different parties  who will command public confidence  both on account of their ability and special fitness for the work  business experience and public training may thus be combined  and the patriotic zeal of the friends of the country be so directed that such a report will be made as to receive the support of all parties  and our finances cease to be the subject of mere partisan contention  the experiment is  at all events  worth a trial  and  in my opinion  it can but prove beneficial to the entire country   the question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest attention  it will be my constant endeavor to secure it by co operation with the other great commercial powers of the world  until that condition is realized when the parity between our gold and silver money springs from and is supported by the relative value of the two metals  the value of the silver already coined and of that which may hereafter be coined  must be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at our command  the credit of the government  the integrity of its currency  and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved  this was the commanding verdict of the people  and it will not be unheeded   economy is demanded in every branch of the government at all times  but especially in periods  like the present  of depression in business and distress among the people  the severest economy must be observed in all public expenditures  and extravagance stopped wherever it is found  and prevented wherever in the future it may be developed  if the revenues are to remain as now  the only relief that can come must be from decreased expenditures  but the present must not become the permanent condition of the government  it has been our uniform practice to retire  not increase our outstanding obligations  and this policy must again be resumed and vigorously enforced  our revenues should always be large enough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and the principal and interest of the public debt  but to make proper and liberal provision for that most deserving body of public creditors  the soldiers and sailors and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners of the united states   the government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its debt in times like the present  suitably to provide against this is the mandate of duty    the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial difficulties  a deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the government exceed its receipts  it can only be met by loans or an increased revenue  while a large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance  inadequate revenue creates distrust and undermines public and private credit  neither should be encouraged  between more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion  we should have more revenue  and that without delay  hindrance  or postponement  a surplus in the treasury created by loans is not a permanent or safe reliance  it will suffice while it lasts  but it can not last long while the outlays of the government are greater than its receipts  as has been the case during the past two years  nor must it be forgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve the situation  the government is still indebted for the amount of the surplus thus accrued  which it must ultimately pay  while its ability to pay is not strengthened  but weakened by a continued deficit  loans are imperative in great emergencies to preserve the government or its credit  but a failure to supply needed revenue in time of peace for the maintenance of either has no justification   the best way for the government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes    not by resorting to loans  but by keeping out of debt    through an adequate income secured by a system of taxation  external or internal  or both  it is the settled policy of the government  pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and administrations  to raise the bulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the united states for sale and consumption  and avoiding  for the most part  every form of direct taxation  except in time of war  the country is clearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal taxation  and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system of tariff taxation  there can be no misunderstanding  either  about the principle upon which this tariff taxation shall be levied  nothing has ever been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling principle in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous care for american interests and american labor  the people have declared that such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and the development of our country  it is  therefore  earnestly hoped and expected that congress will  at the earliest practicable moment  enact revenue legislation that shall be fair  reasonable  conservative  and just  and which  while supplying sufficient revenue for public purposes  will still be signally beneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the people  to this policy we are all  of whatever party  firmly bound by the voice of the people    a power vastly more potential than the expression of any political platform  the paramount duty of congress is to stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation which has always been the firmest prop of the treasury  the passage of such a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the government both at home and abroad  and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold reserve held for the redemption of our currency  which has been heavy and well nigh constant for several years   in the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given to the re enactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the law of 1890  under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign trade in new and advantageous markets for our surplus agricultural and manufactured products  the brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties  the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country  by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves  and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people  but tend to increase their employment   the depression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity upon the great body of toilers of the country  and upon none more than the holders of small farms  agriculture has languished and labor suffered  the revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both  no portion of our population is more devoted to the institution of free government nor more loyal in their support  while none bears more cheerfully or fully its proper share in the maintenance of the government or is better entitled to its wise and liberal care and protection  legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all  the depressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and factory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon them  and they rightfully expect that not only a system of revenue shall be established that will secure the largest income with the least burden  but that every means will be taken to decrease  rather than increase  our public expenditures  business conditions are not the most promising  it will take time to restore the prosperity of former years  if we cannot promptly attain it  we can resolutely turn our faces in that direction and aid its return by friendly legislation  however troublesome the situation may appear  congress will not  i am sure  be found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as legislation can do so  the restoration of confidence and the revival of business  which men of all parties so much desire  depend more largely upon the prompt  energetic  and intelligent action of congress than upon any other single agency affecting the situation   it is inspiring  too  to remember that no great emergency in the one hundred and eight years of our eventful national life has ever arisen that has not been met with wisdom and courage by the american people  with fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny  and to the honor of the american name  these years of glorious history have exalted mankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world  and immeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy  the people love and will sustain these institutions  the great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the government was established and insist upon their faithful observance  equality of rights must prevail  and our laws be always and everywhere respected and obeyed  we may have failed in the discharge of our full duty as citizens of the great republic  but it is consoling and encouraging to realize that free speech  a free press  free thought  free schools  the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and worship  and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally enjoyed to day than ever before  these guaranties must be sacredly preserved and wisely strengthened  the constituted authorities must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld  lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the united states  courts  not mobs  must execute the penalties of the law  the preservation of public order  the right of discussion  the integrity of courts  and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our government securely rests   one of the lessons taught by the late election  which all can rejoice in  is that the citizens of the united states are both law respecting and law abiding people  not easily swerved from the path of patriotism and honor  this is in entire accord with the genius of our institutions  and but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love for law and order in the future  immunity should be granted to none who violate the laws  whether individuals  corporations  or communities  and as the constitution imposes upon the president the duty of both its own execution  and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its provisions  i shall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect  the declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past that of  opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts  or otherwise  to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens   and it has supported  such legislation as will prevent the execution of all schemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies  or by unjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market   this purpose will be steadily pursued  both by the enforcement of the laws now in existence and the recommendation and support of such new statutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect   our naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to the constant promotion of a safer  a better  and a higher citizenship  a grave peril to the republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to understand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence of our institutions and laws  and against all who come here to make war upon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed  nor must we be unmindful of the need of improvement among our own citizens  but with the zeal of our forefathers encourage the spread of knowledge and free education  illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the world which  under providence  we ought to achieve   reforms in the civil service must go on  but the changes should be real and genuine  not perfunctory  or prompted by a zeal in behalf of any party simply because it happens to be in power  as a member of congress i voted and spoke in favor of the present law  and i shall attempt its enforcement in the spirit in which it was enacted  the purpose in view was to secure the most efficient service of the best men who would accept appointment under the government  retaining faithful and devoted public servants in office  but shielding none  under the authority of any rule or custom  who are inefficient  incompetent  or unworthy  the best interests of the country demand this  and the people heartily approve the law wherever and whenever it has been thus administrated   congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our american merchant marine  once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean highways of commerce  to my mind  few more important subjects so imperatively demand its intelligent consideration  the united states has progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and endeavor until we have become foremost in nearly all the great lines of inland trade  commerce  and industry  yet  while this is true  our american merchant marine has been steadily declining until it is now lower  both in the percentage of tonnage and the number of vessels employed  than it was prior to the civil war  commendable progress has been made of late years in the upbuilding of the american navy  but we must supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a merchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign countries  the question is one that appeals both to our business necessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people   it has been the policy of the united states since the foundation of the government to cultivate relations of peace and amity with all the nations of the world  and this accords with my conception of our duty now  we have cherished the policy of non interference with affairs of foreign governments wisely inaugurated by washington  keeping ourselves free from entanglement  either as allies or foes  content to leave undisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic concerns  it will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy  which shall be just  impartial  ever watchful of our national honor  and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of american citizens everywhere  our diplomacy should seek nothing more and accept nothing less than is due us  we want no wars of conquest  we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression  war should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed  peace is preferable to war in almost every contingency  arbitration is the true method of settlement of international as well as local or individual differences  it was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between employers and employees by the forty ninth congress  in 1886  and its application was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous concurrence of the senate and house of the fifty first congress in 1890  the latter resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with us by the british house of commons in 1893  and upon our invitation a treaty of arbitration between the united states and great britain was signed at washington and transmitted to the senate for its ratification in january last  since this treaty is clearly the result of our own initiative  since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire history    the adjustment of difficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms    and since it presents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace  not passion and war  controlling the relations between two of the greatest nations in the world  an example certain to be followed by others  i respectfully urge the early action of the senate thereon  not merely as a matter of policy  but as a duty to mankind  the importance and moral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be overestimated in the cause of advancing civilization  it may well engage the best thought of the statesmen and people of every country  and i cannot but consider it fortunate that it was reserved to the united states to have the leadership in so grand a work   it has been the uniform practice of each president to avoid  as far as possible  the convening of congress in extraordinary session  it is an example which  under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of a public necessity  is to be commended  but a failure to convene the representatives of the people in congress in extra session when it involves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of such neglect upon the executive himself  the condition of the public treasury  as has been indicated  demands the immediate consideration of congress  it alone has the power to provide revenues for the government  not to convene it under such circumstances i can view in no other sense than the neglect of a plain duty  i do not sympathize with the sentiment that congress in session is dangerous to our general business interests  its members are the agents of the people  and their presence at the seat of government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate as an injury  but a benefit  there could be no better time to put the government upon a sound financial and economic basis than now  the people have only recently voted that this should be done  and nothing is more binding upon the agents of their will than the obligation of immediate action  it has always seemed to me that the postponement of the meeting of congress until more than a year after it has been chosen deprived congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and the country of the corresponding benefits  it is evident  therefore  that to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be unwise on the part of the executive because unjust to the interests of the people  our action now will be freer from mere partisan consideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed until the regular session of congress  we are nearly two years from a congressional election  and politics cannot so greatly distract us as if such contest was immediately pending  we can approach the problem calmly and patriotically  without fearing its effect upon an early election   our fellow citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now  even against their preconceived views  and perhaps settled so reasonably  as i trust and believe it will be  as to insure great permanence  than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the united states  again  whatever action congress may take will be given a fair opportunity for trial before the people are called to pass judgment upon it  and this i consider a great essential to the rightful and lasting settlement of the question  in view of these considerations  i shall deem it my duty as president to convene congress in extraordinary session on monday  the 15th day of march  1897   in conclusion  i congratulate the country upon the fraternal spirit of the people and the manifestations of good will everywhere so apparent  the recent election not only most fortunately demonstrated the obliteration of sectional or geographical lines  but to some extent also the prejudices which for years have distracted our councils and marred our true greatness as a nation  the triumph of the people  whose verdict is carried into effect today  is not the triumph of one section  nor wholly of one party  but of all sections and all the people  the north and the south no longer divide on the old lines  but upon principles and policies  and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find cause for true felicitation   let us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit  it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our beloved country  it will be my constant aim to do nothing  and permit nothing to be done  that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation  this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections  but i shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it  let me again repeat the words of the oath administered by the chief justice which  in their respective spheres  so far as applicable  i would have all my countrymen observe   i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states  and will  to the best of my ability  preserve  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states   this is the obligation i have reverently taken before the lord most high  to keep it will be my single purpose  my constant prayer  and i shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistance of all the people in the discharge of my solemn responsibilities  ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens  when we assembled here on the 4th of march  1897  there was great anxiety with regard to our currency and credit  none exists now  then our treasury receipts were inadequate to meet the current obligations of the government  now they are sufficient for all public needs  and we have a surplus instead of a deficit  then i felt constrained to convene the congress in extraordinary session to devise revenues to pay the ordinary expenses of the government  now i have the satisfaction to announce that the congress just closed has reduced taxation in the sum of  41 000 000  then there was deep solicitude because of the long depression in our manufacturing  mining  agricultural  and mercantile industries and the consequent distress of our laboring population  now every avenue of production is crowded with activity  labor is well employed  and american products find good markets at home and abroad   our diversified productions  however  are increasing in such unprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further enlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations  for this purpose reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations should in liberal spirit be carefully cultivated and promoted   the national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed  whatever remains unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with undiminished force upon the executive and the congress  but fortunate as our condition is  its permanence can only be assured by sound business methods and strict economy in national administration and legislation  we should not permit our great prosperity to lead us to reckless ventures in business or profligacy in public expenditures  while the congress determines the objects and the sum of appropriations  the officials of the executive departments are responsible for honest and faithful disbursement  and it should be their constant care to avoid waste and extravagance   honesty  capacity  and industry are nowhere more indispensable than in public employment  these should be fundamental requisites to original appointment and the surest guaranties against removal   four years ago we stood on the brink of war without the people knowing it and without any preparation or effort at preparation for the impending peril  i did all that in honor could be done to avert the war  but without avail  it became inevitable  and the congress at its first regular session  without party division  provided money in anticipation of the crisis and in preparation to meet it  it came  the result was signally favorable to american arms and in the highest degree honorable to the government  it imposed upon us obligations from which we cannot escape and from which it would be dishonorable to seek escape  we are now at peace with the world  and it is my fervent prayer that if differences arise between us and other powers they may be settled by peaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be spared the horrors of war   intrusted by the people for a second time with the office of president  i enter upon its administration appreciating the great responsibilities which attach to this renewed honor and commission  promising unreserved devotion on my part to their faithful discharge and reverently invoking for my guidance the direction and favor of almighty god  i should shrink from the duties this day assumed if i did not feel that in their performance i should have the co operation of the wise and patriotic men of all parties  it encourages me for the great task which i now undertake to believe that those who voluntarily committed to me the trust imposed upon the chief executive of the republic will give to me generous support in my duties to  preserve  protect  and defend  the constitution of the united states  and to  care that the laws be faithfully executed   the national purpose is indicated through a national election  it is the constitutional method of ascertaining the public will  when once it is registered it is a law to us all  and faithful observance should follow its decrees   strong hearts and helpful hands are needed  and  fortunately  we have them in every part of our beloved country  we are reunited  sectionalism has disappeared  division on public questions can no longer be traced by the war maps of 1861  these old differences less and less disturb the judgment  existing problems demand the thought and quicken the conscience of the country  and the responsibility for their presence  as well as for their righteous settlement no more upon me than upon you  there are some national questions in the solution of which patriotism should exclude partisanship  magnifying their difficulties will not take them off our hands nor facilitate their adjustment  distrust of the capacity  integrity  and high purposes of the american people will not be an inspiring theme for future political contests  dark pictures and gloomy forebodings are worse than useless  these only becloud  they do not help to point the way of safety and honor   hope maketh not ashamed   the prophets of evil were not the builders of the republic  nor in its crises since have they saved or served it  the faith of the fathers was a mighty force in its creation  and the faith of their descendants has wrought its progress and furnished its defenders  they are obstructionists who despair  and who would destroy confidence in the ability of our people to solve wisely and for civilization the mighty problems resting upon them  the american people  intrenched in freedom at home  take their love for it with them wherever they go  and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine that we lose our own liberties by securing the enduring foundations of liberty to others  our institutions will not deteriorate by extension  and our sense of justice will not abate under tropic suns in distant seas  as heretofore  so hereafter will the nation demonstrate its fitness to administer any new estate which events devolve upon it  and in the fear of god will  take occasion by the hand and make the bounds of freedom wider yet   if there are those among us who would make our way more difficult  we must not be disheartened  but the more earnestly dedicate ourselves to the task upon which we have rightly entered  the path of progress is seldom smooth  new things are often found hard to do  our fathers found them so  we find them so  they are inconvenient  they cost us something  but are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice  and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed   we will be consoled  to  with the fact that opposition has confronted every onward movement of the republic from its opening hour until now  but without success  the republic has marched on and on  and its step has exalted freedom and humanity  we are undergoing the same ordeal as did our predecessors nearly a century ago  we are following the course they blazed  they triumphed  will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation  surely after 125 years of achievement for mankind we will not now surrender our equality with other powers on matters fundamental and essential to nationality  with no such purpose was the nation created  in no such spirit has it developed its full and independent sovereignty  we adhere to the principle of equality among ourselves  and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a subordinate rank in the family of nations   my fellow citizens  the public events of the past four years have gone into history  they are too near to justify recital  some of them were unforeseen  many of them momentous and far reaching in their consequences to ourselves and our relations with the rest of the world  the part which the united states bore so honorably in the thrilling scenes in china  while new to american life  has been in harmony with its true spirit and best traditions  and in dealing with the results its policy will be that of moderation and fairness   we face at this moment a most important question that of the future relations of the united states and cuba  with our near neighbors we must remain close friends  the declaration of the purposes of this government in the resolution of april 20  1898  must be made good  ever since the evacuation of the island by the army of spain  the executive  with all practicable speed  has been assisting its people in the successive steps necessary to the establishment of a free and independent government prepared to assume and perform the obligations of international law which now rest upon the united states under the treaty of paris  the convention elected by the people to frame a constitution is approaching the completion of its labors  the transfer of american control to the new government is of such great importance  involving an obligation resulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace  that i am glad to be advised by the recent act of congress of the policy which the legislative branch of the government deems essential to the best interests of cuba and the united states  the principles which led to our intervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new government rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation  of observing its international obligations of protecting life and property  insuring order  safety  and liberty  and conforming to the established and historical policy of the united states in its relation to cuba   the peace which we are pledged to leave to the cuban people must carry with it the guaranties of permanence  we became sponsors for the pacification of the island  and we remain accountable to the cubans  no less than to our own country and people  for the reconstruction of cuba as a free commonwealth on abiding foundations of right  justice  liberty  and assured order  our enfranchisement of the people will not be completed until free cuba shall  be a reality  not a name  a perfect entity  not a hasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of failure    while the treaty of peace with spain was ratified on the 6th of february  1899  and ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago  the congress has indicated no form of government for the philippine islands  it has  however  provided an army to enable the executive to suppress insurrection  restore peace  give security to the inhabitants  and establish the authority of the united states throughout the archipelago  it has authorized the organization of native troops as auxiliary to the regular force  it has been advised from time to time of the acts of the military and naval officers in the islands  of my action in appointing civil commissions  of the instructions with which they were charged  of their duties and powers  of their recommendations  and of their several acts under executive commission  together with the very complete general information they have submitted  these reports fully set forth the conditions  past and present  in the islands  and the instructions clearly show the principles which will guide the executive until the congress shall  as it is required to do by the treaty  determine  the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants   the congress having added the sanction of its authority to the powers already possessed and exercised by the executive under the constitution  thereby leaving with the executive the responsibility for the government of the philippines  i shall continue the efforts already begun until order shall be restored throughout the islands  and as fast as conditions permit will establish local governments  in the formation of which the full co operation of the people has been already invited  and when established will encourage the people to administer them  the settled purpose  long ago proclaimed  to afford the inhabitants of the islands self government as fast as they were ready for it will be pursued with earnestness and fidelity  already something has been accomplished in this direction  the government s representatives  civil and military  are doing faithful and noble work in their mission of emancipation and merit the approval and support of their countrymen  the most liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the insurgents  and the way is still open for those who have raised their arms against the government for honorable submission to its authority  our countrymen should not be deceived  we are not waging war against the inhabitants of the philippine islands  a portion of them are making war against the united states  by far the greater part of the inhabitants recognize american sovereignty and welcome it as a guaranty of order and of security for life  property  liberty  freedom of conscience  and the pursuit of happiness  to them full protection will be given  they shall not be abandoned  we will not leave the destiny of the loyal millions the islands to the disloyal thousands who are in rebellion against the united states  order under civil institutions will come as soon as those who now break the peace shall keep it  force will not be needed or used when those who make war against us shall make it no more  may it end without further bloodshed  and there be ushered in the reign of peace to be made permanent by a government of liberty under law  ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens  no people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours  and this is said reverently  in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength  but with gratitude to the giver of good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of well being and of happiness  to us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent  we are the heirs of the ages  and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a bygone civilization  we have not been obliged to fight for our existence against any alien race  and yet our life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away  under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed  and the success which we have had in the past  the success which we confidently believe the future will bring  should cause in us no feeling of vainglory  but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us  a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours  and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a mighty people can thrive best  alike as regards the things of the body and the things of the soul   much has been given us  and much will rightfully be expected from us  we have duties to others and duties to ourselves  and we can shirk neither  we have become a great nation  forced by the fact of its greatness into relations with the other nations of the earth  and we must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities  toward all other nations  large and small  our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship  we must show not only in our words  but in our deeds  that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights  but justice and generosity in a nation  as in an individual  count most when shown not by the weak but by the strong  while ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others  we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves  we wish peace  but we wish the peace of justice  the peace of righteousness  we wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid  no weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us  and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression   our relations with the other powers of the world are important  but still more important are our relations among ourselves  such growth in wealth  in population  and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness  power invariably means both responsibility and danger  our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown  we now face other perils  the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee  modern life is both complex and intense  and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being  never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a democratic republic  the conditions which have told for our marvelous material well being  which have developed to a very high degree our energy  self reliance  and individual initiative  have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers  upon the success of our experiment much depends  not only as regards our own welfare  but as regards the welfare of mankind  if we fail  the cause of free self government throughout the world will rock to its foundations  and therefore our responsibility is heavy  to ourselves  to the world as it is today  and to the generations yet unborn  there is no good reason why we should fear the future  but there is every reason why we should face it seriously  neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending  unflinching purpose to solve them aright   yet  after all  though the problems are new  though the tasks set before us differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded and preserved this republic  the spirit in which these tasks must be undertaken and these problems faced  if our duty is to be well done  remains essentially unchanged  we know that self government is difficult  we know that no people needs such high traits of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely expressed will of the freemen who compose it  but we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty past  they did their work  they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy  we in our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our children s children  to do so we must show  not merely in great crises  but in the everyday affairs of life  the qualities of practical intelligence  of courage  of hardihood  and endurance  and above all the power of devotion to a lofty ideal  which made great the men who founded this republic in the days of washington  which made great the men who preserved this republic in the days of abraham lincoln  ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens  anyone who has taken the oath i have just taken must feel a heavy weight of responsibility  if not  he has no conception of the powers and duties of the office upon which he is about to enter  or he is lacking in a proper sense of the obligation which the oath imposes   the office of an inaugural address is to give a summary outline of the main policies of the new administration  so far as they can be anticipated  i have had the honor to be one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor  and  as such  to hold up his hands in the reforms he has initiated  i should be untrue to myself  to my promises  and to the declarations of the party platform upon which i was elected to office  if i did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration  they were directed to the suppression of the lawlessness and abuses of power of the great combinations of capital invested in railroads and in industrial enterprises carrying on interstate commerce  the steps which my predecessor took and the legislation passed on his recommendation have accomplished much  have caused a general halt in the vicious policies which created popular alarm  and have brought about in the business affected a much higher regard for existing law   to render the reforms lasting  however  and to secure at the same time freedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive business methods  further legislative and executive action are needed  relief of the railroads from certain restrictions of the antitrust law have been urged by my predecessor and will be urged by me  on the other hand  the administration is pledged to legislation looking to a proper federal supervision and restriction to prevent excessive issues of bonds and stock by companies owning and operating interstate commerce railroads   then  too  a reorganization of the department of justice  of the bureau of corporations in the department of commerce and labor  and of the interstate commerce commission  looking to effective cooperation of these agencies  is needed to secure a more rapid and certain enforcement of the laws affecting interstate railroads and industrial combinations   i hope to be able to submit at the first regular session of the incoming congress  in december next  definite suggestions in respect to the needed amendments to the antitrust and the interstate commerce law and the changes required in the executive departments concerned in their enforcement   it is believed that with the changes to be recommended american business can be assured of that measure of stability and certainty in respect to those things that may be done and those that are prohibited which is essential to the life and growth of all business  such a plan must include the right of the people to avail themselves of those methods of combining capital and effort deemed necessary to reach the highest degree of economic efficiency  at the same time differentiating between combinations based upon legitimate economic reasons and those formed with the intent of creating monopolies and artificially controlling prices   the work of formulating into practical shape such changes is creative word of the highest order  and requires all the deliberation possible in the interval  i believe that the amendments to be proposed are just as necessary in the protection of legitimate business as in the clinching of the reforms which properly bear the name of my predecessor   a matter of most pressing importance is the revision of the tariff  in accordance with the promises of the platform upon which i was elected  i shall call congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of march  in order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the dingley act  this should secure an adequate revenue and adjust the duties in such a manner as to afford to labor and to all industries in this country  whether of the farm  mine or factory  protection by tariff equal to the difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here  and have a provision which shall put into force  upon executive determination of certain facts  a higher or maximum tariff against those countries whose trade policy toward us equitably requires such discrimination  it is thought that there has been such a change in conditions since the enactment of the dingley act  drafted on a similarly protective principle  that the measure of the tariff above stated will permit the reduction of rates in certain schedules and will require the advancement of few  if any   the proposal to revise the tariff made in such an authoritative way as to lead the business community to count upon it necessarily halts all those branches of business directly affected  and as these are most important  it disturbs the whole business of the country  it is imperatively necessary  therefore  that a tariff bill be drawn in good faith in accordance with promises made before the election by the party in power  and as promptly passed as due consideration will permit  it is not that the tariff is more important in the long run than the perfecting of the reforms in respect to antitrust legislation and interstate commerce regulation  but the need for action when the revision of the tariff has been determined upon is more immediate to avoid embarrassment of business  to secure the needed speed in the passage of the tariff bill  it would seem wise to attempt no other legislation at the extra session  i venture this as a suggestion only  for the course to be taken by congress  upon the call of the executive  is wholly within its discretion   in the mailing of a tariff bill the prime motive is taxation and the securing thereby of a revenue  due largely to the business depression which followed the financial panic of 1907  the revenue from customs and other sources has decreased to such an extent that the expenditures for the current fiscal year will exceed the receipts by  100 000 000  it is imperative that such a deficit shall not continue  and the framers of the tariff bill must  of course  have in mind the total revenues likely to be produced by it and so arrange the duties as to secure an adequate income  should it be impossible to do so by import duties  new kinds of taxation must be adopted  and among these i recommend a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection   the obligation on the part of those responsible for the expenditures made to carry on the government  to be as economical as possible  and to make the burden of taxation as light as possible  is plain  and should be affirmed in every declaration of government policy  this is especially true when we are face to face with a heavy deficit  but when the desire to win the popular approval leads to the cutting off of expenditures really needed t make the government effective and to enable it to accomplish its proper objects  the result is as much to be condemned as the waste of government funds in unnecessary expenditure  the scope of a modern government in what it can and ought to accomplish for its people has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by the old  laissez faire  school of political writers  and this widening has met popular approval   in the department of agriculture the use of scientific experiments on a large scale and the spread of information derived from them for the improvement of general agriculture must go on   the importance of supervising business of great railways and industrial combinations and the necessary investigation and prosecution of unlawful business methods are another necessary tax upon government which did not exist half a century ago   the putting into force of laws which shall secure the conservation of our resources  so far as they may be within the jurisdiction of the federal government  including the most important work of saving and restoring our forests and the great improvement of waterways  are all proper government functions which must involve large expenditure if properly performed  while some of them  like the reclamation of arid lands  are made to pay for themselves  others are of such an indirect benefit that this cannot be expected of them  a permanent improvement  like the panama canal  should be treated as a distinct enterprise  and should be paid for by the proceeds of bonds  the issue of which will distribute its cost between the present and future generations in accordance with the benefits derived  it may well be submitted to the serious consideration of congress whether the deepening and control of the channel of a great river system  like that of the ohio or of the mississippi  when definite and practical plans for the enterprise have been approved and determined upon  should not be provided for in the same way   then  too  there are expenditures of government absolutely necessary if our country is to maintain its proper place among the nations of the world  and is to exercise its proper influence in defense of its own trade interests in the maintenance of traditional american policy against the colonization of european monarchies in this hemisphere  and in the promotion of peace and international morality  i refer to the cost of maintaining a proper army  a proper navy  and suitable fortifications upon the mainland of the united states and in its dependencies   we should have an army so organized and so officered as to be capable in time of emergency  in cooperation with the national militia and under the provisions of a proper national volunteer law  rapidly to expand into a force sufficient to resist all probable invasion from abroad and to furnish a respectable expeditionary force if necessary in the maintenance of our traditional american policy which bears the name of president monroe   our fortifications are yet in a state of only partial completeness  and the number of men to man them is insufficient  in a few years however  the usual annual appropriations for our coast defenses  both on the mainland and in the dependencies  will make them sufficient to resist all direct attack  and by that time we may hope that the men to man them will be provided as a necessary adjunct  the distance of our shores from europe and asia of course reduces the necessity for maintaining under arms a great army  but it does not take away the requirement of mere prudence    that we should have an army sufficiently large and so constituted as to form a nucleus out of which a suitable force can quickly grow   what has been said of the army may be affirmed in even a more emphatic way of the navy  a modern navy can not be improvised  it must be built and in existence when the emergency arises which calls for its use and operation  my distinguished predecessor has in many speeches and messages set out with great force and striking language the necessity for maintaining a strong navy commensurate with the coast line  the governmental resources  and the foreign trade of our nation  and i wish to reiterate all the reasons which he has presented in favor of the policy of maintaining a strong navy as the best conservator of our peace with other nations  and the best means of securing respect for the assertion of our rights  the defense of our interests  and the exercise of our influence in international matters   our international policy is always to promote peace  we shall enter into any war with a full consciousness of the awful consequences that it always entails  whether successful or not  and we  of course  shall make every effort consistent with national honor and the highest national interest to avoid a resort to arms  we favor every instrumentality  like that of the hague tribunal and arbitration treaties made with a view to its use in all international controversies  in order to maintain peace and to avoid war  but we should be blind to existing conditions and should allow ourselves to become foolish idealists if we did not realize that  with all the nations of the world armed and prepared for war  we must be ourselves in a similar condition  in order to prevent other nations from taking advantage of us and of our inability to defend our interests and assert our rights with a strong hand   in the international controversies that are likely to arise in the orient growing out of the question of the open door and other issues the united states can maintain her interests intact and can secure respect for her just demands  she will not be able to do so  however  if it is understood that she never intends to back up her assertion of right and her defense of her interest by anything but mere verbal protest and diplomatic note  for these reasons the expenses of the army and navy and of coast defenses should always be considered as something which the government must pay for  and they should not be cut off through mere consideration of economy  our government is able to afford a suitable army and a suitable navy  it may maintain them without the slightest danger to the republic or the cause of free institutions  and fear of additional taxation ought not to change a proper policy in this regard   the policy of the united states in the spanish war and since has given it a position of influence among the nations that it never had before  and should be constantly exerted to securing to its bona fide citizens  whether native or naturalized  respect for them as such in foreign countries  we should make every effort to prevent humiliating and degrading prohibition against any of our citizens wishing temporarily to sojourn in foreign countries because of race or religion   the admission of asiatic immigrants who cannot be amalgamated with our population has been made the subject either of prohibitory clauses in our treaties and statutes or of strict administrative regulation secured by diplomatic negotiation  i sincerely hope that we may continue to minimize the evils likely to arise from such immigration without unnecessary friction and by mutual concessions between self respecting governments  meantime we must take every precaution to prevent  or failing that  to punish outbursts of race feeling among our people against foreigners of whatever nationality who have by our grant a treaty right to pursue lawful business here and to be protected against lawless assault or injury   this leads me to point out a serious defect in the present federal jurisdiction  which ought to be remedied at once  having assured to other countries by treaty the protection of our laws for such of their subjects or citizens as we permit to come within our jurisdiction  we now leave to a state or a city  not under the control of the federal government  the duty of performing our international obligations in this respect  by proper legislation we may  and ought to  place in the hands of the federal executive the means of enforcing the treaty rights of such aliens in the courts of the federal government  it puts our government in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagements to protect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform those engagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in states or cities  not within our control  if we would promise we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise  we cannot permit the possible failure of justice  due to local prejudice in any state or municipal government  to expose us to the risk of a war which might be avoided if federal jurisdiction was asserted by suitable legislation by congress and carried out by proper proceedings instituted by the executive in the courts of the national government   one of the reforms to be carried out during the incoming administration is a change of our monetary and banking laws  so as to secure greater elasticity in the forms of currency available for trade and to prevent the limitations of law from operating to increase the embarrassment of a financial panic  the monetary commission  lately appointed  is giving full consideration to existing conditions and to all proposed remedies  and will doubtless suggest one that will meet the requirements of business and of public interest   we may hope that the report will embody neither the narrow dew of those who believe that the sole purpose of the new system should be to secure a large return on banking capital or of those who would have greater expansion of currency with little regard to provisions for its immediate redemption or ultimate security  there is no subject of economic discussion so intricate and so likely to evoke differing views and dogmatic statements as this one  the commission  in studying the general influence of currency on business and of business on currency  have wisely extended their investigations in european banking and monetary methods  the information that they have derived from such experts as they have found abroad will undoubtedly be found helpful in the solution of the difficult problem they have in hand   the incoming congress should promptly fulfill the promise of the republican platform and pass a proper postal savings bank bill  it will not be unwise or excessive paternalism  the promise to repay by the government will furnish an inducement to savings deposits which private enterprise can not supply and at such a low rate of interest as not to withdraw custom from existing banks  it will substantially increase the funds available for investment as capital in useful enterprises  it will furnish absolute security which makes the proposed scheme of government guaranty of deposits so alluring  without its pernicious results   i sincerely hope that the incoming congress will be alive  as it should be  to the importance of our foreign trade and of encouraging it in every way feasible  the possibility of increasing this trade in the orient  in the philippines  and in south america are known to everyone who has given the matter attention  the direct effect of free trade between this country and the philippines will be marked upon our sales of cottons  agricultural machinery  and other manufactures  the necessity of the establishment of direct lines of steamers between north and south america has been brought to the attention of congress by my predecessor and by mr  root before and after his noteworthy visit to that continent  and i sincerely hope that congress may be induced to see the wisdom of a tentative effort to establish such lines by the use of mail subsidies   the importance of the part which the departments of agriculture and of commerce and labor may play in ridding the markets of europe of prohibitions and discriminations against the importation of our products is fully understood  and it is hoped that the use of the maximum and minimum feature of our tariff law to be soon passed will be effective to remove many of those restrictions   the panama canal will have a most important bearing upon the trade between the eastern and far western sections of our country  and will greatly increase the facilities for transportation between the eastern and the western seaboard  and may possibly revolutionize the transcontinental rates with respect to bulky merchandise  it will also have a most beneficial effect to increase the trade between the eastern seaboard of the united states and the western coast of south america  and  indeed  with some of the important ports on the east coast of south america reached by rail from the west coast   the work on the canal is making most satisfactory progress  the type of the canal as a lock canal was fixed by congress after a full consideration of the conflicting reports of the majority and minority of the consulting board  and after the recommendation of the war department and the executive upon those reports  recent suggestion that something had occurred on the isthmus to make the lock type of the canal less feasible than it was supposed to be when the reports were made and the policy determined on led to a visit to the isthmus of a board of competent engineers to examine the gatun dam and locks  which are the key of the lock type  the report of that board shows nothing has occurred in the nature of newly revealed evidence which should change the views once formed in the original discussion  the construction will go on under a most effective organization controlled by colonel goethals and his fellow army engineers associated with him  and will certainly be completed early in the next administration  if not before   some type of canal must be constructed  the lock type has been selected  we are all in favor of having it built as promptly as possible  we must not now  therefore  keep up a fire in the rear of the agents whom we have authorized to do our work on the isthmus  we must hold up their hands  and speaking for the incoming administration i wish to say that i propose to devote all the energy possible and under my control to pushing of this work on the plans which have been adopted  and to stand behind the men who are doing faithful  hard work to bring about the early completion of this  the greatest constructive enterprise of modern times   the governments of our dependencies in porto rico and the philippines are progressing as favorably as could be desired  the prosperity of porto rico continues unabated  the business conditions in the philippines are not all that we could wish them to be  but with the passage of the new tariff bill permitting free trade between the united states and the archipelago  with such limitations on sugar and tobacco as shall prevent injury to domestic interests in those products  we can count on an improvement in business conditions in the philippines and the development of a mutually profitable trade between this country and the islands  meantime our government in each dependency is upholding the traditions of civil liberty and increasing popular control which might be expected under american auspices  the work which we are doing there redounds to our credit as a nation   i look forward with hope to increasing the already good feeling between the south and the other sections of the country  my chief purpose is not to effect a change in the electoral vote of the southern states  that is a secondary consideration  what i look forward to is an increase in the tolerance of political views of all kinds and their advocacy throughout the south  and the existence of a respectable political opposition in every state  even more than this  to an increased feeling on the part of all the people in the south that this government is their government  and that its officers in their states are their officers   the consideration of this question can not  however  be complete and full without reference to the negro race  its progress and its present condition  the thirteenth amendment secured them freedom  the fourteenth amendment due process of law  protection of property  and the pursuit of happiness  and the fifteenth amendment attempted to secure the negro against any deprivation of the privilege to vote because he was a negro  the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments have been generally enforced and have secured the objects for which they are intended  while the fifteenth amendment has not been generally observed in the past  it ought to be observed  and the tendency of southern legislation today is toward the enactment of electoral qualifications which shall square with that amendment  of course  the mere adoption of a constitutional law is only one step in the right direction  it must be fairly and justly enforced as well  in time both will come  hence it is clear to all that the domination of an ignorant  irresponsible element can be prevented by constitutional laws which shall exclude from voting both negroes and whites not having education or other qualifications thought to be necessary for a proper electorate  the danger of the control of an ignorant electorate has therefore passed  with this change  the interest which many of the southern white citizens take in the welfare of the negroes has increased  the colored men must base their hope on the results of their own industry  self restraint  thrift  and business success  as well as upon the aid and comfort and sympathy which they may receive from their white neighbors of the south   there was a time when northerners who sympathized with the negro in his necessary struggle for better conditions sought to give him the suffrage as a protection to enforce its exercise against the prevailing sentiment of the south  the movement proved to be a failure  what remains is the fifteenth amendment to the constitution and the right to have statutes of states specifying qualifications for electors subjected to the test of compliance with that amendment  this is a great protection to the negro  it never will be repealed  and it never ought to be repealed  if it had not passed  it might be difficult now to adopt it  but with it in our fundamental law  the policy of southern legislation must and will tend to obey it  and so long as the statutes of the states meet the test of this amendment and are not otherwise in conflict with the constitution and laws of the united states  it is not the disposition or within the province of the federal government to interfere with the regulation by southern states of their domestic affairs  there is in the south a stronger feeling than ever among the intelligent well to do  and influential element in favor of the industrial education of the negro and the encouragement of the race to make themselves useful members of the community  the progress which the negro has made in the last fifty years  from slavery  when its statistics are reviewed  is marvelous  and it furnishes every reason to hope that in the next twenty five years a still greater improvement in his condition as a productive member of society  on the farm  and in the shop  and in other occupations may come   the negroes are now americans  their ancestors came here years ago against their will  and this is their only country and their only flag  they have shown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it  encountering the race feeling against them  subjected at times to cruel injustice growing out of it  they may well have our profound sympathy and aid in the struggle they are making  we are charged with the sacred duty of making their path as smooth and easy as we can  any recognition of their distinguished men  any appointment to office from among their number  is properly taken as an encouragement and an appreciation of their progress  and this just policy should be pursued when suitable occasion offers   but it may well admit of doubt whether  in the case of any race  an appointment of one of their number to a local office in a community in which the race feeling is so widespread and acute as to interfere with the ease and facility with which the local government business can be done by the appointee is of sufficient benefit by way of encouragement to the race to outweigh the recurrence and increase of race feeling which such an appointment is likely to engender  therefore the executive  in recognizing the negro race by appointments  must exercise a careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good  on the other hand  we must be careful not to encourage the mere pretense of race feeling manufactured in the interest of individual political ambition   personally  i have not the slightest race prejudice or feeling  and recognition of its existence only awakens in my heart a deeper sympathy for those who have to bear it or suffer from it  and i question the wisdom of a policy which is likely to increase it  meantime  if nothing is done to prevent it  a better feeling between the negroes and the whites in the south will continue to grow  and more and more of the white people will come to realize that the future of the south is to be much benefited by the industrial and intellectual progress of the negro  the exercise of political franchises by those of this race who are intelligent and well to do will be acquiesced in  and the right to vote will be withheld only from the ignorant and irresponsible of both races   there is one other matter to which i shall refer  it was made the subject of great controversy during the election and calls for at least a passing reference now  my distinguished predecessor has given much attention to the cause of labor  with whose struggle for better things he has shown the sincerest sympathy  at his instance congress has passed the bill fixing the liability of interstate carriers to their employees for injury sustained in the course of employment  abolishing the rule of fellow servant and the common law rule as to contributory negligence  and substituting therefor the so called rule of  comparative negligence   it has also passed a law fixing the compensation of government employees for injuries sustained in the employ of the government through the negligence of the superior  it has also passed a model child labor law for the district of columbia  in previous administrations an arbitration law for interstate commerce railroads and their employees  and laws for the application of safety devices to save the lives and limbs of employees of interstate railroads had been passed  additional legislation of this kind was passed by the outgoing congress   i wish to say that insofar as i can i hope to promote the enactment of further legislation of this character  i am strongly convinced that the government should make itself as responsible to employees injured in its employ as an interstate railway corporation is made responsible by federal law to its employees  and i shall be glad  whenever any additional reasonable safety device can be invented to reduce the loss of life and limb among railway employees  to urge congress to require its adoption by interstate railways   another labor question has arisen which has awakened the most excited discussion  that is in respect to the power of the federal courts to issue injunctions in industrial disputes  as to that  my convictions are fixed  take away from the courts  if it could be taken away  the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes  and it would create a privileged class among the laborers and save the lawless among their number from a most needful remedy available to all men for the protection of their business against lawless invasion  the proposition that business is not a property or pecuniary right which can be protected by equitable injunction is utterly without foundation in precedent or reason  the proposition is usually linked with one to make the secondary boycott lawful  such a proposition is at variance with the american instinct  and will find no support  in my judgment  when submitted to the american people  the secondary boycott is an instrument of tyranny  and ought not to be made legitimate   the issue of a temporary restraining order without notice has in several instances been abused by its inconsiderate exercise  and to remedy this the platform upon which i was elected recommends the formulation in a statute of the conditions under which such a temporary restraining order ought to issue  a statute can and ought to be framed to embody the best modern practice  and can bring the subject so closely to the attention of the court as to make abuses of the process unlikely in the future  the american people  if i understand them  insist that the authority of the courts shall be sustained  and are opposed to any change in the procedure by which the powers of a court may be weakened and the fearless and effective administration of justice be interfered with   having thus reviewed the questions likely to recur during my administration  and having expressed in a summary way the position which i expect to take in recommendations to congress and in my conduct as an executive  i invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my fellow citizens and the aid of the almighty god in the discharge of my responsible duties  ',\n",
       " 'there has been a change of government  it began two years ago  when the house of representatives became democratic by a decisive majority  it has now been completed  the senate about to assemble will also be democratic  the offices of president and vice president have been put into the hands of democrats  what does the change mean  that is the question that is uppermost in our minds today  that is the question i am going to try to answer  in order  if i may  to interpret the occasion   it means much more than the mere success of a party  the success of a party means little except when the nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose  no one can mistake the purpose for which the nation now seeks to use the democratic party  it seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view  some old things with which we had grown familiar  and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our lives  have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon them  with fresh  awakened eyes  have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister  some new things  as we look frankly upon them  willing to comprehend their real character  have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar  stuff of our own convictions  we have been refreshed by a new insight into our own life   we see that in many things that life is very great  it is incomparably great in its material aspects  in its body of wealth  in the diversity and sweep of its energy  in the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men  it is great  also  very great  in its moral force  nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong  alleviate suffering  and set the weak in the way of strength and hope  we have built up  moreover  a great system of government  which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change  against storm and accident  our life contains every great thing  and contains it in rich abundance   but the evil has come with the good  and much fine gold has been corroded  with riches has come inexcusable waste  we have squandered a great part of what we might have used  and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature  without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent  scorning to be careful  shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient  we have been proud of our industrial achievements  but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost  the cost of lives snuffed out  of energies overtaxed and broken  the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through  the groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears  the solemn  moving undertone of our life  coming up out of the mines and factories  and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat  with the great government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid  fearless eyes  the great government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes  and those who used it had forgotten the people   at last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole  we see the bad with the good  the debased and decadent with the sound and vital  with this vision we approach new affairs  our duty is to cleanse  to reconsider  to restore  to correct the evil without impairing the good  to purify and humanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it  there has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great  our thought has been  let every man look out for himself  let every generation look out for itself   while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves  we had not forgotten our morals  we remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful  with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play  and remembered it with pride  but we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great   we have come now to the sober second thought  the scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes  we have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts  our work is a work of restoration   we have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief items  a tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world  violates the just principles of taxation  and makes the government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests  a banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits  an industrial system which  take it on all its sides  financial as well as administrative  holds capital in leading strings  restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor  and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country  a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm  or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs  watercourses undeveloped  waste places unreclaimed  forests untended  fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal  unregarded waste heaps at every mine  we have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production  but we have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry  as statesmen  or as individuals   nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity  in safeguarding the health of the nation  the health of its men and its women and its children  as well as their rights in the struggle for existence  this is no sentimental duty  the firm basis of government is justice  not pity  these are matters of justice  there can be no equality or opportunity  the first essential of justice in the body politic  if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives  their very vitality  from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter  control  or singly cope with  society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts  the first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves  sanitary laws  pure food laws  and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency   these are some of the things we ought to do  and not leave the others undone  the old fashioned  never to be neglected  fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right  this is the high enterprise of the new day  to lift everything that concerns our life as a nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man s conscience and vision of the right  it is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans  it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste  we shall restore  not destroy  we shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified  not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon  and step by step we shall make it what it should be  in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge  not shallow self satisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither they can not tell  justice  and only justice  shall always be our motto   and yet it will be no cool process of mere science  the nation has been deeply stirred  stirred by a solemn passion  stirred by the knowledge of wrong  of ideals lost  of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil  the feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of god s own presence  where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother are one  we know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through  whether we be able to understand our time and the need of our people  whether we be indeed their spokesmen and interpreters  whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action   this is not a day of triumph  it is a day of dedication  here muster  not the forces of party  but the forces of humanity  men s hearts wait upon us  men s lives hang in the balance  men s hopes call upon us to say what we will do  who shall live up to the great trust  who dares fail to try  i summon all honest men  all patriotic  all forward looking men  to my side  god helping me  i will not fail

       " 'my fellow citizens  the four years which have elapsed since last i stood in this place have been crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence  perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of important reforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changes in the spirit and purpose of our political action  we have sought very thoughtfully to set our house in order  correct the grosser errors and abuses of our industrial life  liberate and quicken the processes of our national genius and energy  and lift our politics to a broader view of the people s essential interests   it is a record of singular variety and singular distinction  but i shall not attempt to review it  it speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence as the years go by  this is not the time for retrospect  it is time rather to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present and the immediate future   although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentration and success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago  other matters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention    matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control  but which  despite our wish to keep free of them  have drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence   it has been impossible to avoid them  they have affected the life of the whole world  they have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an apprehension they never knew before  it has been hard to preserve calm counsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that under their influence  we are a composite and cosmopolitan people  we are of the blood of all the nations that are at war  the currents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back and forth between us and them  the war inevitably set its mark from the first alike upon our minds  our industries  our commerce  our politics and our social action  to be indifferent to it  or independent of it  was out of the question   and yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of it  in that consciousness  despite many divisions  we have drawn closer together  we have been deeply wronged upon the seas  but we have not wished to wrong or injure in return  have retained throughout the consciousness of standing in some sort apart  intent upon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war itself   as some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have still been clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not ready to demand for all mankind    fair dealing  justice  the freedom to live and to be at ease against organized wrong   it is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and more aware  more and more certain that the part we wished to play was the part of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace  we have been obliged to arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of right and of freedom of action  we stand firm in armed neutrality since it seems that in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannot forget  we may even be drawn on  by circumstances  not by our own purpose or desire  to a more active assertion of our rights as we see them and a more immediate association with the great struggle itself  but nothing will alter our thought or our purpose  they are too clear to be obscured  they are too deeply rooted in the principles of our national life to be altered  we desire neither conquest nor advantage  we wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another people  we always professed unselfish purpose and we covet the opportunity to prove our professions are sincere   there are many things still to be done at home  to clarify our own politics and add new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life  and we shall do them as time and opportunity serve  but we realize that the greatest things that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stage and in cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind  and we are making our spirits ready for those things   we are provincials no longer  the tragic events of the thirty months of vital turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world  there can be no turning back  our own fortunes as a nation are involved whether we would have it so or not   and yet we are not the less americans on that account  we shall be the more american if we but remain true to the principles in which we have been bred  they are not the principles of a province or of a single continent  we have known and boasted all along that they were the principles of a liberated mankind  these  therefore  are the things we shall stand for  whether in war or in peace   that all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in the political stability of free peoples  and equally responsible for their maintenance  that the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations in all matters of right or privilege  that peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power  that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and that no other powers should be supported by the common thought  purpose or power of the family of nations  that the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples  under rules set up by common agreement and consent  and that  so far as practicable  they should be accessible to all upon equal terms  that national armaments shall be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic safety  that the community of interest and of power upon which peace must henceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually suppressed and prevented   i need not argue these principles to you  my fellow countrymen  they are your own part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motives in affairs  they spring up native amongst us  upon this as a platform of purpose and of action we can stand together  and it is imperative that we should stand together  we are being forged into a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout the world  in their ardent heat we shall  in god s providence  let us hope  be purged of faction and division  purified of the errant humors of party and of private interest  and shall stand forth in the days to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit  let each man see to it that the dedication is in his own heart  the high purpose of the nation in his own mind  ruler of his own will and desire   i stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have been audience because the people of the united states have chosen me for this august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment named me their leader in affairs   i know now what the task means  i realize to the full the responsibility which it involves  i pray god i may be given the wisdom and the prudence to do my duty in the true spirit of this great people  i am their servant and can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their confidence and their counsel  the thing i shall count upon  the thing without which neither counsel nor action will avail  is the unity of america    an america united in feeling  in purpose and in its vision of duty  of opportunity and of service   we are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the necessities of the nation to their own private profit or use them for the building up of private power   united alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve to perform it in the face of all men  let us dedicate ourselves to the great task to which we must now set our hand  for myself i beg your tolerance  your countenance and your united aid   the shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled  and we shall walk with the light all about us if we be but true to ourselves    to ourselves as we have wished to be known in the counsels of the world and in the thought of all those who love liberty and justice and the right exalted  ',\n",
       " 'my countrymen   when one surveys the world about him after the great storm  noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it  if he is an american he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope  we have seen a world passion spend its fury  but we contemplate our republic unshaken  and hold our civilization secure  liberty    liberty within the law    and civilization are inseparable  and though both were threatened we find them now secure  and there comes to americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both   standing in this presence  mindful of the solemnity of this occasion  feeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great weight of responsibility for himself  i must utter my belief in the divine inspiration of the founding fathers  surely there must have been god s intent in the making of this new world republic  ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity  and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood  with union maintained  the nation supreme  and its concord inspiring  we have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought  we have seen civil  human  and religious liberty verified and glorified  in the beginning the old world scoffed at our experiment  today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken  a precious inheritance to ourselves  an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind  let us express renewed and strengthened devotion  in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning  and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment   the recorded progress of our republic  materially and spiritually in itself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in old world affairs  confident of our ability to work out our own destiny  and jealously guarding our right to do so  we seek no part in directing the destinies of the old world  we do not mean to be entangled  we will accept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment  in each instance  may determine   our eyes never will be blind to a developing menace  our ears never deaf to the call of civilization  we recognize the new order in the world  with the closer contacts which progress has wrought  we sense the call of the human heart for fellowship  fraternity  and cooperation  we crave friendship and harbor no hate  but america  our america  the america builded on the foundation laid by the inspired fathers  can be a party to no permanent military alliance  it can enter into no political commitments  nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our decisions to any other than our own authority   i am sure our own people will not misunderstand  nor will the world misconstrue  we have no thought to impede the paths to closer relationship  we wish to promote understanding  we want to do our part in making offensive warfare so hateful that governments and peoples who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaws before the bar of civilization   we are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world  great and small  for conference  for counsel  to seek the expressed views of world opinion  to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments  we elect to participate in suggesting plans for mediation  conciliation  and arbitration  and would gladly join in that expressed conscience of progress  which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international relationship  and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto  in expressing aspirations  in seeking practical plans  in translating humanity s new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite  but every commitment must be made in the exercise of our national sovereignty  since freedom impelled  and independence inspired  and nationality exalted  a world supergovernment is contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our republic  this is not selfishness  it is sanctity  it is not aloofness  it is security  it is not suspicion of others  it is patriotic adherence to the things which made us what we are   today  better than ever before  we know the aspirations of humankind  and share them  we have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our nation by the world  the unselfishness of these united states is a thing proven  our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world is well established  our concern for preserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression  there was no american failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization  there will be no failure today or tomorrow   the success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate  intelligent  dependable popular will of america  in a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of national policy  where internationality was to supersede nationality  we turned to a referendum  to the american people  there was ample discussion  and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding   america is ready to encourage  eager to initiate  anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war  and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be god s highest conception of human relationship  because we cherish ideals of justice and peace  because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world  we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization  and we hold a maintained america  the proven republic  the unshaken temple of representative democracy  to be not only an inspiration and example  but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents   mankind needs a world wide benediction of understanding  it is needed among individuals  among peoples  among governments  and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order  in such understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of their better relationships and nations will promote the comities so essential to peace   we must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacy  and none may receive except as he gives  we have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius  notably on our own continent  where a galaxy of republics reflects the glory of new world democracy  but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence   perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a republic s capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war  while the world s embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor desolated cities  left no gaping wounds  no breast with hate  it did involve us in the delirium of expenditure  in expanded currency and credits  in unbalanced industry  in unspeakable waste  and disturbed relationships  while it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at home  it also revealed the heart of america as sound and fearless  and beating in confidence unfailing   amid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy  where our freedom never has made offensive warfare  never has sought territorial aggrandizement through force  never has turned to the arbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted  when the governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it  i believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written   let me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present today  and through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the republic for their sacrifices in its defense  a generous country will never forget the services you rendered  and you may hope for a policy under government that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your places on another such occasion as this   our supreme task is the resumption of our onward  normal way  reconstruction  readjustment  restoration all these must follow  i would like to hasten them  if it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task  let me repeat for our nation  we shall give no people just cause to make war upon us  we hold no national prejudices  we entertain no spirit of revenge  we do not hate  we do not covet  we dream of no conquest  nor boast of armed prowess   if  despite this attitude  war is again forced upon us  i earnestly hope a way may be found which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all america  materially and spiritually  body and soul  to national defense  i can vision the ideal republic  where every man and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service  military or civic  the individual is best fitted  where we may call to universal service every plant  agency  or facility  all in the sublime sacrifice for country  and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual  corporation  or combination  but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the nation  there is something inherently wrong  something out of accord with the ideals of representative democracy  when one portion of our citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war while another is fighting  sacrificing  or dying for national preservation   out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose  a new confidence and consecration  which would make our defense impregnable  our triumph assured  then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic  industrial  and commercial systems at home  no staggering war debts  no swollen fortunes to flout the sacrifices of our soldiers  no excuse for sedition  no pitiable slackerism  no outrage of treason  envy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development  and revolution would be without the passion which engenders it   a regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not  however  blind us to the tasks of today  war never left such an aftermath  there has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials  nations are still groping for return to stable ways  discouraging indebtedness confronts us like all the war torn nations  and these obligations must be provided for  no civilization can survive repudiation   we can reduce the abnormal expenditures  and we will  we can strike at war taxation  and we must  we must face the grim necessity  with full knowledge that the task is to be solved  and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable laws of nature  our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of government  and at the same time do for it too little  we contemplate the immediate task of putting our public household in order  we need a rigid and yet sane economy  combined with fiscal justice  and it must be attended by individual prudence and thrift  which are so essential to this trying hour and reassuring for the future   the business world reflects the disturbance of war s reaction  herein flows the lifeblood of material existence  the economic mechanism is intricate and its parts interdependent  and has suffered the shocks and jars incident to abnormal demands  credit inflations  and price upheavals  the normal balances have been impaired  the channels of distribution have been clogged  the relations of labor and management have been strained  we must seek the readjustment with care and courage  our people must give and take  prices must reflect the receding fever of war activities  perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages again  because war invariably readjusts compensations  and the necessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship  but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability  all the penalties will not be light  nor evenly distributed  there is no way of making them so  there is no instant step from disorder to order  we must face a condition of grim reality  charge off our losses and start afresh  it is the oldest lesson of civilization  i would like government to do all it can to mitigate  then  in understanding  in mutuality of interest  in concern for the common good  our tasks will be solved  no altered system will work a miracle  any wild experiment will only add to the confusion  our best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven system   the forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable  peoples are turning from destruction to production  industry has sensed the changed order and our own people are turning to resume their normal  onward way  the call is for productive america to go on  i know that congress and the administration will favor every wise government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continued progress   i speak for administrative efficiency  for lightened tax burdens  for sound commercial practices  for adequate credit facilities  for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems  for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business  for an end to government s experiment in business  and for more efficient business in government administration  with all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activities  so that social  industrial  and economic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous people   with the nation wide induction of womanhood into our political life  we may count upon her intuitions  her refinements  her intelligence  and her influence to exalt the social order  we count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state   i wish for an america no less alert in guarding against dangers from within than it is watchful against enemies from without  our fundamental law recognizes no class  no group  no section  there must be none in legislation or administration  the supreme inspiration is the common weal  humanity hungers for international peace  and we crave it with all mankind  my most reverent prayer for america is for industrial peace  with its rewards  widely and generally distributed  amid the inspirations of equal opportunity  no one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are  we have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality  and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement   if revolution insists upon overturning established order  let other peoples make the tragic experiment  there is no place for it in america  when world war threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation  and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration  ours is a constitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and minorities are sacredly protected  our revisions  reformations  and evolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress  and we mean to cure our ills  but never destroy or permit destruction by force   i had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering  the earth is thirsting for the cup of good will  understanding is its fountain source  i would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend   it has been proved again and again that we cannot  while throwing our markets open to the world  maintain american standards of living and opportunity  and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition  there is a luring fallacy in the theory of banished barriers of trade  but preserved american standards require our higher production costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports  today  as never before  when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion  we must adjust our tariffs to the new order  we seek participation in the world s exchanges  because therein lies our way to widened influence and the triumphs of peace  we know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy  and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry  opportunity is calling not alone for the restoration  but for a new era in production  transportation and trade  we shall answer it best by meeting the demand of a surpassing home market  by promoting self reliance in production  and by bidding enterprise  genius  and efficiency to carry our cargoes in american bottoms to the marts of the world   we would not have an america living within and for herself alone  but we would have her self reliant  independent  and ever nobler  stronger  and richer  believing in our higher standards  reared through constitutional liberty and maintained opportunity  we invite the world to the same heights  but pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task  common welfare is the goal of our national endeavor  wealth is not inimical to welfare  it ought to be its friendliest agency  there never can be equality of rewards or possessions so long as the human plan contains varied talents and differing degrees of industry and thrift  but ours ought to be a country free from the great blotches of distressed poverty  we ought to find a way to guard against the perils and penalties of unemployment  we want an america of homes  illumined with hope and happiness  where mothers  freed from the necessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors  may preside as befits the hearthstone of american citizenship  we want the cradle of american childhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no blight may touch it in its development  and we want to provide that no selfish interest  no material necessity  no lack of opportunity shall prevent the gaining of that education so essential to best citizenship   there is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realities  the world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief of ill considered remedies for social and economic disorders  but we are mindful today as never before of the friction of modern industrialism  and we must learn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober and tested methods  where genius has made for great possibilities  justice and happiness must be reflected in a greater common welfare   service is the supreme commitment of life  i would rejoice to acclaim the era of the golden rule and crown it with the autocracy of service  i pledge an administration wherein all the agencies of government are called to serve  and ever promote an understanding of government purely as an expression of the popular will   one cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendous responsibility  the world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks  but with the realization comes the surge of high resolve  and there is reassurance in belief in the god given destiny of our republic  if i felt that there is to be sole responsibility in the executive for the america of tomorrow i should shrink from the burden  but here are a hundred millions  with common concern and shared responsibility  answerable to god and country  the republic summons them to their duty  and i invite co operation   i accept my part with single mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit  and implore the favor and guidance of god in his heaven  with these i am unafraid  and confidently face the future   i have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of holy writ wherein it is asked   what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly  and to love mercy  and to walk humbly with thy god   this i plight to god and country     ',\n",
       " 'my countrymen   no one can contemplate current conditions without finding much that is satisfying and still more that is encouraging  our own country is leading the world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict  many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years  and the secondary and indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time  but we are beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued  what remedies ought to be applied  what actions should be taken for our deliverance  and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully and conscientiously to adopt these methods of relief  already we have sufficiently rearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned  business has revived  and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which is gradually reaching into every part of the nation  realizing that we can not live unto ourselves alone  we have contributed of our resources and our counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputes among the european nations  because of what america is and what america has done  a firmer courage  a higher hope  inspires the heart of all humanity   these results have not occurred by mere chance  they have been secured by a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extending over many generations  we can not continue these brilliant successes in the future  unless we continue to learn from the past  it is necessary to keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continually before us  if we are to have any science of government  if we wish to erect new structures  we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations  we must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in the universe and that the essentials of human relationship do not change  we must frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our political firmament if we expect to hold a true course  if we examine carefully what we have done  we can determine the more accurately what we can do   we stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since our national consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action with an array of force  the old sentiment of detached and dependent colonies disappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent nation  men began to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broader opportunities of a national constitution  under the eternal urge of freedom we became an independent nation  a little less than 50 years later that freedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world  and guarded  supported  and secured by the monroe doctrine  the narrow fringe of states along the atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers across the hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down the golden slope to the pacific  we made freedom a birthright  we extended our domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interests and accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty upon less favored peoples  in the defense of our own ideals and in the general cause of liberty we entered the great war  when victory had been fully secured  we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousness of duty done   throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom  we have strengthened our independence  we have been  and propose to be  more and more american  we believe that we can best serve our own country and most successfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to be openly and candidly  in tensely and scrupulously  american  if we have any heritage  it has been that  if we have any destiny  we have found it in that direction   but if we wish to continue to be distinctively american  we must continue to make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desires of a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relations to pursue a conscientious and religious life  we can not permit ourselves to be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases  it is not the adjective  but the substantive  which is of real importance  it is not the name of the action  but the result of the action  which is the chief concern  it will be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolation or entanglement of pacifists and militarists  the physical configuration of the earth has separated us from all of the old world  but the common brotherhood of man  the highest law of all our being  has united us by inseparable bonds with all humanity  our country represents nothing but peaceful intentions toward all the earth  but it ought not to fail to maintain such a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a great people  it ought to be a balanced force  intensely modem  capable of defense by sea and land  beneath the surface and in the air  but it should be so conducted that all the world may see in it  not a menace  but an instrument of security and peace   this nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which the rights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected  it has never found that the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only by a great and threatening array of arms  in common with other nations  it is now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendliness and good will  through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance  we have never practiced the policy of competitive armaments  we have recently committed ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitation of our sea power  as one result of this  our navy ranks larger  in comparison  than it ever did before  removing the burden of expense and jealousy  which must always accrue from a keen rivalry  is one of the most effective methods of diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which are the most potent means of fomenting war  this policy represents a new departure in the world  it is a thought  an ideal  which has led to an entirely new line of action  it will not be easy to maintain  some never moved from their old positions  some are constantly slipping back to the old ways of thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force  america has taken the lead in this new direction  and that lead america must continue to hold  if we expect others to rely on our fairness and justice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice   if we are to judge by past experience  there is much to be hoped for in international relations from frequent conferences and consultations  we have before us the beneficial results of the washington conference and the various consultations recently held upon european affairs  some of which were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we were active participants  even the failures can not but be accounted useful and an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare  i am strongly in favor of continuation of this policy  whenever conditions are such that there is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured   in conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather than a threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse among nations  we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes by methods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure that result  the same considerations should lead to our adherence to the permanent court of international justice  where great principles are involved  where great movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movements their actual support  we ought not to withhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential difference  but only upon the ground of the most important and compelling fundamental reasons  we can not barter away our independence or our sovereignty  but we ought to engage in no refinements of logic  no sophistries  and no subterfuges  to argue away the undoubted duty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers  the power of its resources  and its position of leadership in the world  actively and comprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of the responsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishment of a tribunal for the administration of even handed justice between nation and nation  the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial  not by battle but by reason   we have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of any other countries  especially are we determined not to become implicated in the political controversies of the old world  with a great deal of hesitation  we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order  protect life and property  and establish responsible government in some of the small countries of the western hemisphere  our private citizens have advanced large sums of money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the old world  we have not failed  nor shall we fail to respond  whenever necessary to mitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressed nations  these  too  are requirements which must be met by reason of our vast powers and the place we hold in the world   some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formula for permanent peace  undoubtedly the clarification of the principles of international law would be helpful  and the efforts of scholars to prepare such a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathy and support  much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those who advocate the outlawing of aggressive war  but all these plans and preparations  these treaties and covenants  will not of themselves be adequate  one of the greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which people find themselves subjected  one of the most practical things to be done in the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed  so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived  there must be some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by success and prosperity  in the making and financing of such adjustments there is not only an opportunity  but a real duty  for america to respond with her counsel and her resources  conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out of their difficulties  but there is another element  more important than all  without which there can not be the slightest hope of a permanent peace  that element lies in the heart of humanity  unless the desire for peace be cherished there  unless this fundamental and only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest degree  all artificial efforts will be in vain  peace will come when there is realization that only under a reign of law  based on righteousness and supported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man  can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying life  parchment will fail  the sword will fail  it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant   it seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these important objects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence  we are not identified with any old world interests  this position should be made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries  we are at peace with all of them  our program is never to oppress  but always to assist  but while we do justice to others  we must require that justice be done to us  with us a treaty of peace means peace  and a treaty of amity means amity  we have made great contributions to the settlement of contentious differences in both europe and asia  but there is a very definite point beyond which we can not go  we can only help those who help themselves  mindful of these limitations  the one great duty that stands out requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world   while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have done abroad  we must remember that our continued success in that direction depends upon what we do at home  since its very outset  it has been found necessary to conduct our government by means of political parties  that system would not have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentally sound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expression of the popular will  it is not necessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly  it is enough to know that nothing better has been devised  no one would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunity for independence of action within the party  there is no salvation in a narrow and bigoted partisanship  but if there is to be responsible party government  the party label must be something more than a mere device for securing office  unless those who are elected under the same party designation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficient loyalty and coherence  so that they can cooperate with each other in the support of the broad general principles  of the party platform  the election is merely a mockery  no decision is made at the polls  and there is no representation of the popular will  common honesty and good faith with the people who support a party at the polls require that party  when it enters office  to assume the control of that portion of the government to which it has been elected  any other course is bad faith and a violation of the party pledges   when the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by making it a majority in the congress  it has a right to expect such unity of action as will make the party majority an effective instrument of government  this administration has come into power with a very clear and definite mandate from the people  the expression of the popular will in favor of maintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive  there was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courts that we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come  likewise  the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilities met with unmistakable defeat  the people declared that they wanted their rights to have not a political but a judicial determination  and their independence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownership and control of their property  not in the government  but in their own hands  as they always do when they have a fair chance  the people demonstrated that they are sound and are determined to have a sound government   when we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted  the policy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in public expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation  the principle involved in this effort is that of conservation  the resources of this country are almost beyond computation  no mind can comprehend them  but the cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition  not only those who are now making their tax returns  but those who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills  know by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does  no matter what others may want  these people want a drastic economy  they are opposed to waste  they know that extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of their labor  i favor the policy of economy  not because i wish to save money  but because i wish to save people  the men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the government  every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager  every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant  economy is idealism in its most practical form   if extravagance were not reflected in taxation  and through taxation both directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people  it would not be of so much consequence  the wisest and soundest method of solving our tax problem is through economy  fortunately  of all the great nations this country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy  we do not any longer need wartime revenues  the collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required  which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare  is only a species of legalized larceny  under this republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them  the only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity  the property of the country belongs to the people of the country  their title is absolute  they do not support any privileged class  they do not need to maintain great military forces  they ought not to be burdened with a great array of public employees  they are not required to make any contribution to government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess upon themselves through the action of their own representatives  whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people  but if they do not act for themselves  no one can be very successful in acting for them   the time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction  when  unless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living  we must have tax reform  the method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business  it ought to encourage it  i am opposed to extremely high rates  because they produce little or no revenue  because they are bad for the country  and  finally  because they are wrong  we can not finance the country  we can not improve social conditions  through any system of injustice  even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich  those who suffer the most harm will be the poor  this country believes in prosperity  it is absurd to suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous  the wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful  the verdict of the country has been given on this question  that verdict stands  we shall do well to heed it   these questions involve moral issues  we need not concern ourselves much about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rights of persons  under our institutions their rights are supreme  it is not property but the right to hold property  both great and small  which our constitution guarantees  all owners of property are charged with a service  these rights and duties have been revealed  through the conscience of society  to have a divine sanction  the very stability of our society rests upon production and conservation  for individuals or for governments to waste and squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard these obligations  the result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moral decay   these policies of better international understandings  greater economy  and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrial relations  under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration and a protective tariff  employment is plentiful  the rate of pay is high  and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen  our transportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been able to meet all the requirements of the service  agriculture has been ver slow in reviving  but the price of cereals at last indicates that the day of its deliverance is at hand   we are not without our problems  but our most important problem is not to secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess  our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments  our divided sovereignty composed of nation and state  the matchless wisdom that is enshrined in our constitution  all these need constant effort and tireless vigilance for their protection and support   in a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedience to law  under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject  he has no voice in its making  no influence in its administration  it does not represent him  under a free government the citizen makes his own laws  chooses his own administrators  which do represent him  those who want their rights respected under the constitution and the law ought to set the example themselves of observing the constitution and the law  while there may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times  the barbarian and the defective always violate it  those who disregard the rules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence  are not promoting freedom and independence  are not following the path of civilization  but are displaying the traits of ignorance  of servitude  of savagery  and treading the way that leads back to the jungle   the essence of a republic is representative government  our congress represents the people and the states  in all legislative affairs it is the natural collaborator with the president  in spite of all the criticism which often falls to its lot  i do not hesitate to say that there is no more independent and effective legislative body in the world  it is  and should be  jealous of its prerogative  i welcome its cooperation  and expect to share with it not only the responsibility  but the credit  for our common effort to secure beneficial legislation   these are some of the principles which america represents  we have not by any means put them fully into practice  but we have strongly signified our belief in them  the encouraging feature of our country is not that it has reached its destination  but that it has overwhelmingly expressed its determination to proceed in the right direction  it is true that we could  with profit  be less sectional and more national in our thought  it would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorant prejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race  but the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect  we were all found loyal to a common citizenship  the fundamental precept of liberty is toleration  we can not permit any inquisition either within or without the law or apply any religious test to the holding of office  the mind of america must be forever free   it is in such contemplations  my fellow countrymen  which are not exhaustive but only representative  that i find ample warrant for satisfaction and encouragement  we should not let the much that is to do obscure the much which has been done  the past and present show faith and hope and courage fully justified  here stands our country  an example of tranquillity at home  a patron of tranquillity abroad  here stands its government  aware of its might but obedient to its conscience  here it will continue to stand  seeking peace and prosperity  solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner  promoting enterprise  developing waterways and natural resources  attentive to the intuitive counsel of womanhood  encouraging education  desiring the advancement of religion  supporting the cause of justice and honor among the nations  america seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force  no ambition  no temptation  lures her to thought of foreign dominions  the legions which she sends forth are armed  not with the sword  but with the cross  the higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankind is not of human  but of divine origin  she cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of almighty god     ',\n",
       " 'my countrymen  this occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an american citizen  it is a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people  i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever increasing burdens   it is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concerning some of the matters of present importance    our progress if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad  we find many satisfactions  we find some causes for concern  we have emerged from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction following it with increased virility and strength  from this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world  what america has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people  in the large view  we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world  through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before  the devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere  we are steadily building a new race    a new civilization great in its own attainments  the influence and high purposes of our nation are respected among the peoples of the world  we aspire to distinction in the world  but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives  for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge   but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self government must be safeguarded  the strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease    the failure of our system of criminal justice the most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law  crime is increasing  confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing  i am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the american people  i am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws   it is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment  the problem is much wider than that  many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment   to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice  the redistribution of its functions  the simplification of its procedure  the provision of additional special tribunals  the better selection of juries  and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift  while the authority of the federal government extends to but part of our vast system of national  state  and local justice  yet the standards which the federal government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure   we are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judges and attorneys  but the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present day conditions  its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals  there is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities  subterfuge  and delay  the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost   reform  reorganization and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system  both in civil and criminal sides  have been advocated for years by statesmen  judges  and bar associations  first steps toward that end should not longer be delayed  rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom  the basis of all ordered liberty  the vital force of progress  it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen  by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law  or by combinations of criminals  justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized  to consider these evils  to find their remedy  is the most sore necessity of our times    enforcement of the eighteenth amendment of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment  part are due to the causes i have just mentioned  but part are due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws  with the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor   but a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens  there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it  we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime   i have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country  i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities  but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you  as citizens  extend  the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist  no greater national service can be given by men and women of good will    who  i know  are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship    than that they should  by their example  assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor  our whole system of self government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizens elect what laws they will support  the worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law  for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life  of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws  if citizens do not like a law  their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation  their right is openly to work for its repeal   to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law  fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people  their activities must be stopped    a national investigation i propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence  to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it  its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable  in the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the treasury department to the department of justice as a beginning of more effective organization    the relation of government to business cooperation by the government the larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders  our people have in recent years developed a new found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare  it is an advance toward the highest conception of self government  self government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone  progress is born of cooperation in the community    not from governmental restraints  the government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self help by itself cooperating with them  business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service  in stability  in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses  such progress  however  can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law   there is an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies  state  municipal and private  in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health  recreation  education  and the home  we have need further to perfect the means by which government can be adapted to human service    education although education is primarily a responsibility of the states and local communities  and rightly so  yet the nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality  self government can succeed only through an instructed electorate  our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy  the nation has marched far beyond that  the more complex the problems of the nation become  the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction  moreover  as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention  we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life  we can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people  one civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class  if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people  we must draw constantly from the general mass  the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership    public health in public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era  many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure  public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education  the returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits  and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness    world peace the united states fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress  prosperity  and peace are interlocked with the progress  prosperity  and peace of all humanity  the whole world is at peace  the dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world  no suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country   those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion  for economic or other domination of other peoples  such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom  our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples  superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population  in wealth and power except that of imperialism  they fail to see that the american people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system  a new social system  a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism  they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning  that our people are seeking a larger vision through art  literature  science  and travel  that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life    that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man  they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel  but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization  it will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings  we not only desire peace with the world  but to see peace maintained throughout the world  we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force   the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations  its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament  the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world  but its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations  in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation  arbitration  and judicial settlement  american statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world  the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character  the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship  no more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment  the reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted  the united states seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court  the way should  and i believe will  be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace   our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations  which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries  they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress   i have lately returned from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere  i have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country  we are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them  they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress  we wish only for the maintenance of their independence  the growth of their stability  and their prosperity  while we have had wars in the western hemisphere  yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world  fortunately the new world is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the old world  we should keep it so   it is impossible  my countrymen  to speak of peace without profound emotion  in thousands of homes in america  in millions of homes around the world  there are vacant chairs  it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died  surely civilization is old enough  surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace  abroad  to west and east  are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields  most of these nations have contributed to our race  to our culture  our knowledge  and our progress  from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions  their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own   peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense  peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies  but it will become a reality only through self restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness  i covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace    party responsibilities in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties  we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will  and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people  it follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power  but the government is that of the whole people  the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being  the animosities of elections should have no place in our government  for government must concern itself alone with the common weal    special session of the congress action upon some of the proposals upon which the republican party was returned to power  particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff  cannot in justice to our farmers  our labor  and our manufacturers be postponed  i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two questions  i shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the congress    other mandates from the election it appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution  the vigorous enforcement of the laws  the continuance of economy in public expenditure  the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community  the denial of ownership or operation of business by the government in competition with its citizens  the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations  the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government  the expansion of public works  and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home   these were the more tangible determinations of the election  but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of america  these ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day to day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested  more than this  the government must  so far as lies within its proper powers  give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations  no one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions  we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be  the preservation of self government and its full foundations in local government  the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields  the maintenance of ordered liberty  the denial of domination by any group or class  the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity  the stimulation of initiative and individuality  absolute integrity in public affairs  the choice of officials for fitness to office  the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty  the freedom of public opinion  the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge  the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths  the strengthening of the home  the advancement of peace   there is no short road to the realization of these aspirations  ours is a progressive people  but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience  ill considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them  but if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals  we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children    conclusion this is not the time and place for extended discussion  the questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards  they are not the problems of degeneration  they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement  and that responsibility rests upon you  my countrymen  as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office   ours is a land rich in resources  stimulating in its glorious beauty  filled with millions of happy homes  blessed with comfort and opportunity  in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced  in no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure  in no nation is the government more worthy of respect  no country is more loved by its people  i have an abiding faith in their capacity  integrity and high purpose  i have no fears for the future of our country  it is bright with hope   in the presence of my countrymen  mindful of the solemnity of this occasion  knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves  i beg your tolerance  your aid  and your cooperation  i ask the help of almighty god in this service to my country to which you have called me     ',\n",
       " 'i am certain that my fellow americans expect that on my induction into the presidency i will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels  this is preeminently the time to speak the truth  the whole truth  frankly and boldly  nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today  this great nation will endure as it has endured  will revive and will prosper  so  first of all  let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself    nameless  unreasoning  unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance  in every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory  i am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days   in such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties  they concern  thank god  only material things  values have shrunken to fantastic levels  taxes have risen  our ability to pay has fallen  government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income  the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade  the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side  farmers find no markets for their produce  the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone   more important  a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence  and an equally great number toil with little return  only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment   yet our distress comes from no failure of substance  we are stricken by no plague of locusts  compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid  we have still much to be thankful for  nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it  plenty is at our doorstep  but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply  primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind s goods have failed  through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence  have admitted their failure  and abdicated  practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion  rejected by the hearts and minds of men   true they have tried  but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition  faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money  stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership  they have resorted to exhortations  pleading tearfully for restored confidence  they know only the rules of a generation of self seekers  they have no vision  and when there is no vision the people perish   the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization  we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths  the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit   happiness lies not in the mere possession of money  it lies in the joy of achievement  in the thrill of creative effort  the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits  these dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men   recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit  and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing  small wonder that confidence languishes  for it thrives only on honesty  on honor  on the sacredness of obligations  on faithful protection  on unselfish performance  without them it cannot live   restoration calls  however  not for changes in ethics alone  this nation asks for action  and action now   our greatest primary task is to put people to work  this is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously  it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself  treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war  but at the same time  through this employment  accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources   hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and  by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution  endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land  the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities  it can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms  it can be helped by insistence that the federal  state  and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced  it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered  uneconomical  and unequal  it can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character  there are many ways in which it can be helped  but it can never be helped merely by talking about it  we must act and act quickly   finally  in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order  there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments  there must be an end to speculation with other people s money  and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency   there are the lines of attack  i shall presently urge upon a new congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment  and i shall seek the immediate assistance of the several states   through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo  our international trade relations  though vastly important  are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy  i favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first  i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment  but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment   the basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic  it is the insistence  as a first consideration  upon the interdependence of the various elements in all parts of the united states    a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer  it is the way to recovery  it is the immediate way  it is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure   in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor    the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and  because he does so  respects the rights of others    the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors   if i read the temper of our people correctly  we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other  that we can not merely take but we must give as well  that if we are to go forward  we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline  because without such discipline no progress is made  no leadership becomes effective  we are  i know  ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline  because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good  this i propose to offer  pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife   with this pledge taken  i assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems   action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors  our constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form  that is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced  it has met every stress of vast expansion of territory  of foreign wars  of bitter internal strife  of world relations   it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us  but it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure   i am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require  these measures  or such other measures as the congress may build out of its experience and wisdom  i shall seek  within my constitutional authority  to bring to speedy adoption   but in the event that the congress shall fail to take one of these two courses  and in the event that the national emergency is still critical  i shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me  i shall ask the congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis    broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency  as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe   for the trust reposed in me i will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time  i can do no less   we face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of the national unity  with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values  with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike  we aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life   we do not distrust the future of essential democracy  the people of the united states have not failed  in their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct  vigorous action  they have asked for discipline and direction under leadership  they have made me the present instrument of their wishes  in the spirit of the gift i take it   in this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of god  may he protect each and every one of us  may he guide me in the days to come     ',\n",
       " 'when four years ago we met to inaugurate a president  the republic  single minded in anxiety  stood in spirit here  we dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision    to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness  we of the republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it  to end by action  tireless and unafraid  the stagnation and despair of that day  we did those first things first   our covenant with ourselves did not stop there  instinctively we recognized a deeper need    the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever rising problems of a complex civilization  repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered  for  without that aid  we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind  to do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men   we of the republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable  to solve problems once considered unsolvable  we would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as  after centuries of fatalistic suffering  we had found a way to master epidemics of disease  we refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster   in this we americans were discovering no wholly new truth  we were writing a new chapter in our book of self government   this year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the constitutional convention which made us a nation  at that convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the revolutionary war  they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution  a century and a half ago they established the federal government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the american people   today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives   four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct  they hold out the clear hope that government within communities  government within the separate states  and government of the united states can do the things the times require  without yielding its democracy  our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday   nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase  so power to govern them also must increase    power to stop evil  power to do good  the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power  but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections  the constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent   in fact  in these last four years  we have made the exercise of all power more democratic  for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public s government  the legend that they were invincible    above and beyond the processes of a democracy    has been shattered  they have been challenged and beaten   our progress out of the depression is obvious  but that is not all that you and i mean by the new order of things  our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with secondhand materials  by using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations   in that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit  old truths have been relearned  untruths have been unlearned  we have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals  we know now that it is bad economics  out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays  we are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal  and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world   this new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such  we are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life   in this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned  hard headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness  we are moving toward an era of good feeling  but we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will   for these reasons i am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of america   among men of good will  science and democracy together offer an ever richer life and ever larger satisfaction to the individual  with this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order  we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress   shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead  shall we call this the promised land  or  shall we continue on our way  for  each age is a dream that is dying  or one that is coming to birth    many voices are heard as we face a great decision  comfort says   tarry a while   opportunism says   this is a good spot   timidity asks   how difficult is the road ahead    true  we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair  vitality has been preserved  courage and confidence have been restored  mental and moral horizons have been extended   but our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstances  advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering  the times were on the side of progress   to hold to progress today  however  is more difficult  dulled conscience  irresponsibility  and ruthless self interest already reappear  such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster  prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose   let us ask again  have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of march 1933  have we found our happy valley   i see a great nation  upon a great continent  blessed with a great wealth of natural resources  its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves  they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations  i see a united states which can demonstrate that  under democratic methods of government  national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown  and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence   but here is the challenge to our democracy  in this nation i see tens of millions of its citizens    a substantial part of its whole population    who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life   i see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day   i see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so called polite society half a century ago   i see millions denied education  recreation  and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children   i see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions   i see one third of a nation ill housed  ill clad  ill nourished   it is not in despair that i paint you that picture  i paint it for you in hope    because the nation  seeing and understanding the injustice in it  proposes to paint it out  we are determined to make every american citizen the subject of his country s interest and concern  and we will never regard any faithful law abiding group within our borders as superfluous  the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much  it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little   if i know aught of the spirit and purpose of our nation  we will not listen to comfort  opportunism  and timidity  we will carry on   overwhelmingly  we of the republic are men and women of good will  men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication  men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well  they will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will   government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people  it can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts  it can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does   if i know aught of the will of our people  they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained  they will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and  therefore  strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace   today we reconsecrate our country to long cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization  in every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together  in our personal ambitions we are individualists  but in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation  we all go up  or else we all go down  as one people   to maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods  a vast amount of humility  but out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need  then political leadership can voice common ideals  and aid in their realization   in taking again the oath of office as president of the united states  i assume the solemn obligation of leading the american people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance   while this duty rests upon me i shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will  seeking divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace  ',\n",
       " 'on each national day of inauguration since 1789  the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the united states   in washington s day the task of the people was to create and weld together a nation   in lincoln s day the task of the people was to preserve that nation from disruption from within   in this day the task of the people is to save that nation and its institutions from disruption from without   to us there has come a time  in the midst of swift happenings  to pause for a moment and take stock    to recall what our place in history has been  and to rediscover what we are and what we may be  if we do not  we risk the real peril of inaction   lives of nations are determined not by the count of years  but by the lifetime of the human spirit  the life of a man is three score years and ten  a little more  a little less  the life of a nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live   there are men who doubt this  there are men who believe that democracy  as a form of government and a frame of life  is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that  for some unexplained reason  tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future    and that freedom is an ebbing tide   but we americans know that this is not true   eight years ago  when the life of this republic seemed frozen by a fatalistic terror  we proved that this is not true  we were in the midst of shock    but we acted  we acted quickly  boldly  decisively   these later years have been living years    fruitful years for the people of this democracy  for they have brought to us greater security and  i hope  a better understanding that life s ideals are to be measured in other than material things   most vital to our present and our future is this experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at home  put away many evil things  built new structures on enduring lines  and  through it all  maintained the fact of its democracy   for action has been taken within the three way framework of the constitution of the united states  the coordinate branches of the government continue freely to function  the bill of rights remains inviolate  the freedom of elections is wholly maintained  prophets of the downfall of american democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught   democracy is not dying   we know it because we have seen it revive  and grow   we know it cannot die    because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise    an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority   we know it because democracy alone  of all forms of government  enlists the full force of men s enlightened will   we know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life   we know it because  if we look below the surface  we sense it still spreading on every continent    for it is the most humane  the most advanced  and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society   a nation  like a person  has a body  a body that must be fed and clothed and housed  invigorated and rested  in a manner that measures up to the objectives of our time   a nation  like a person  has a mind    a mind that must be kept informed and alert  that must know itself  that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors    all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world   and a nation  like a person  has something deeper  something more permanent  something larger than the sum of all its parts  it is that something which matters most to its future    which calls forth the most sacred guarding of its present   it is a thing for which we find it difficult    even impossible    to hit upon a single  simple word   and yet we all understand what it is    the spirit    the faith of america  it is the product of centuries  it was born in the multitudes of those who came from many lands    some of high degree  but mostly plain people  who sought here  early and late  to find freedom more freely   the democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history  it is human history  it permeated the ancient life of early peoples  it blazed anew in the middle ages  it was written in magna charta   in the americas its impact has been irresistible  america has been the new world in all tongues  to all peoples  not because this continent was a new found land  but because all those who came here believed they could create upon this continent a new life    a life that should be new in freedom   its vitality was written into our own mayflower compact  into the declaration of independence  into the constitution of the united states  into the gettysburg address   those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit  and the millions who followed  and the stock that sprang from them    all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation   the hopes of the republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self serving wealth   we know that we still have far to go  that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen  in the measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land   but it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone  it is not enough to clothe and feed the body of this nation  and instruct and inform its mind  for there is also the spirit  and of the three  the greatest is the spirit   without the body and the mind  as all men know  the nation could not live   but if the spirit of america were killed  even though the nation s body and mind  constricted in an alien world  lived on  the america we know would have perished   that spirit    that faith    speaks to us in our daily lives in ways often unnoticed  because they seem so obvious  it speaks to us here in the capital of the nation  it speaks to us through the processes of governing in the sovereignties of 48 states  it speaks to us in our counties  in our cities  in our towns  and in our villages  it speaks to us from the other nations of the hemisphere  and from those across the seas    the enslaved  as well as the free  sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voices of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom is such an old  old story   the destiny of america was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first president in his first inaugural in 1789    words almost directed  it would seem  to this year of 1941   the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered deeply  finally  staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the american people    if we lose that sacred fire  if we let it be smothered with doubt and fear    then we shall reject the destiny which washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish  the preservation of the spirit and faith of the nation does  and will  furnish the highest justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense   in the face of great perils never before encountered  our strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy   for this we muster the spirit of america  and the faith of america   we do not retreat  we are not content to stand still  as americans  we go forward  in the service of our country  by the will of god  ',\n",
       " 'chief justice  mr  vice president  my friends  you will understand and  i believe  agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words brief   we americans of today  together with our allies  are passing through a period of supreme test  it is a test of our courage    of our resolve    of our wisdom    our essential democracy   if we meet that test    successfully and honorably    we shall perform a service of historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time   as i stand here today  having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of my fellow countrymen    in the presence of our god    i know that it is america s purpose that we shall not fail   in the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just and honorable peace  a durable peace  as today we work and fight for total victory in war   we can and we will achieve such a peace   we shall strive for perfection  we shall not achieve it immediately    but we still shall strive  we may make mistakes    but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle   i remember that my old schoolmaster  dr  peabody  said  in days that seemed to us then to be secure and untroubled   things in life will not always run smoothly  sometimes we will be rising toward the heights    then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward  the great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward  that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend    our constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument  it is not perfect yet  but it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men  of all races and colors and creeds  could build our solid structure of democracy   and so today  in this year of war  1945  we have learned lessons    at a fearful cost    and we shall profit by them   we have learned that we cannot live alone  at peace  that our own well being is dependent on the well being of other nations far away  we have learned that we must live as men  not as ostriches  nor as dogs in the manger   we have learned to be citizens of the world  members of the human community   we have learned the simple truth  as emerson said  that  the only way to have a friend is to be one    we can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear  we can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding  the confidence  and the courage which flow from conviction   the almighty god has blessed our land in many ways  he has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth  he has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world   so we pray to him now for the vision to see our way clearly    to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men    to the achievement of his will to peace on earth     ',\n",
       " 'mr  vice president  mr  chief justice  and fellow citizens  i accept with humility the honor which the american people have conferred upon me  i accept it with a deep resolve to do all that i can for the welfare of this nation and for the peace of the world   in performing the duties of my office  i need the help and prayers of every one of you  i ask for your encouragement and your support  the tasks we face are difficult  and we can accomplish them only if we work together   each period of our national history has had its special challenges  those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past  today marks the beginning not only of a new administration  but of a period that will be eventful  perhaps decisive  for us and for the world   it may be our lot to experience  and in large measure to bring about  a major turning point in the long history of the human race  the first half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks on the rights of man  and by the two most frightful wars in history  the supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony   the peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty  composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears  in this time of doubt  they look to the united states as never before for good will  strength  and wise leadership   it is fitting  therefore  that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the essential principles of the faith by which we live  and to declare our aims to all peoples   the american people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this nation from the beginning  we believe that all men have a right to equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good  we believe that all men have the right to freedom of thought and expression  we believe that all men are created equal because they are created in the image of god   from this faith we will not be moved   the american people desire  and are determined to work for  a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit  and to achieve a decent and satisfying life  above all else  our people desire  and are determined to work for  peace on earth    a just and lasting peace  based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals   in the pursuit of these aims  the united states and other like minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life   that regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom  security  and greater opportunity to mankind  misled by this philosophy  many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery  poverty and tyranny  are their reward   that false philosophy is communism   communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is unable to govern himself  and therefore requires the rule of strong masters   democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity  as well as the inalienable right  to govern himself with reason and justice   communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause  punishment without trial  and forced labor as the chattel of the state  it decrees what information he shall receive  what art he shall produce  what leaders he shall follow  and what thoughts he shall think   democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the individual  and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of his abilities   communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence   democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change   communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable   democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain lasting peace   these differences between communism and democracy do not concern the united states alone  people everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material well being  human dignity  and the right to believe in and worship god   i state these differences  not to draw issues of belief as such  but because the actions resulting from the communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace   since the end of hostilities  the united states has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace  stability  and freedom to the world   we have sought no territory and we have imposed our will on none  we have asked for no privileges we would not extend to others   we have constantly and vigorously supported the united nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations  we have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations   we have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon  and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments   we have encouraged  by precept and example  the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis   almost a year ago  in company with 16 free nations of europe  we launched the greatest cooperative economic program in history  the purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in europe  so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world   our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind  we have beaten back despair and defeatism  we have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty  hundreds of millions of people all over the world now agree with us  that we need not have war    that we can have peace   the initiative is ours   we are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice  we shall have as our partners countries which  no longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival  are now working to improve the standards of living of all their people  we are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen the free world   in the coming years  our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major courses of action   first  we will continue to give unfaltering support to the united nations and related agencies  and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness  we believe that the united nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self government under democratic principles   second  we will continue our programs for world economic recovery   this means  first of all  that we must keep our full weight behind the european recovery program  we are confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery  we believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of self supporting nations once again   in addition  we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume  economic recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade   third  we will strengthen freedom loving nations against the dangers of aggression   we are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the north atlantic area  such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the united nations charter   we have already established such a defense pact for the western hemisphere by the treaty of rio de janeiro   the primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter  each country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense   if we can make it sufficiently clear  in advance  that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force  the armed attack might never occur   i hope soon to send to the senate a treaty respecting the north atlantic security plan   in addition  we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security   fourth  we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas   more than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery  their food is inadequate  they are victims of disease  their economic life is primitive and stagnant  their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas   for the first time in history  humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people   the united states is pre eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques  the material resources which we can afford to use for the assistance of other peoples are limited  but our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible   i believe that we should make available to peace loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life  and  in cooperation with other nations  we should foster capital investment in areas needing development   our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world  through their own efforts  to produce more food  more clothing  more materials for housing  and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens   we invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertaking  their contributions will be warmly welcomed  this should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the united nations and its specialized agencies wherever practicable  it must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace  plenty  and freedom   with the cooperation of business  private capital  agriculture  and labor in this country  this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of living   such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to benefit the peoples of the areas in which they are established  guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments   the old imperialism    exploitation for foreign profit    has no place in our plans  what we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing   all countries  including our own  will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world s human and natural resources  experience shows that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and economically   greater production is the key to prosperity and peace  and the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge   only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent  satisfying life that is the right of all people   democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world into triumphant action  not only against their human oppressors  but also against their ancient enemies    hunger  misery  and despair   on the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind   if we are to be successful in carrying out these policies  it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong   slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity   we are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear    even by those who live today in fear under their own governments   we are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda    who desire truth and sincerity   we are aided by all who desire self government and a voice in deciding their own affairs   we are aided by all who long for economic security    for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy   we are aided by all who desire freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and freedom to live their own lives for useful ends   our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness   in due time  as our stability becomes manifest  as more and more nations come to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance  i believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences   events have brought our american democracy to new influence and new responsibilities  they will test our courage  our devotion to duty  and our concept of liberty   but i say to all men  what we have achieved in liberty  we will surpass in greater liberty   steadfast in our faith in the almighty  we will advance toward a world where man s freedom is secure   to that end we will devote our strength  our resources  and our firmness of resolve  with god s help  the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice  harmony  and peace  ',\n",
       " 'my friends  before i begin the expression of those thoughts that i deem appropriate to this moment  would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own  and i ask that you bow your heads   almighty god  as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching that thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng  and their fellow citizens everywhere   give us  we pray  the power to discern clearly right from wrong  and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby  and by the laws of this land  especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station  race  or calling   may cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who  under the concepts of our constitution  hold to differing political faiths  so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and thy glory  amen   my fellow citizens   the world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge  we sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history   this fact defines the meaning of this day  we are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service  in the presence of god  we are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free   since this century s beginning  a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth  masses of asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past  great nations of europe have fought their bloodiest wars  thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared  new nations have been born   for our own country  it has been a time of recurring trial  we have grown in power and in responsibility  we have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man s history  seeking to secure peace in the world  we have had to fight through the forests of the argonne  to the shores of iwo jima  and to the cold mountains of korea   in the swift rush of great events  we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live  in our quest of understanding  we beseech god s guidance  we summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future  we bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question   how far have we come in man s long pilgrimage from darkness toward light  are we nearing the light  a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind  or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us   great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home  concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future  each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by  and often even created by  this question that involves all humankind   this trial comes at a moment when man s power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages  we can turn rivers in their courses  level mountains to the plains  oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce  disease diminishes and life lengthens   yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible  nations amass wealth  labor sweats to create    and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities  science seems ready to confer upon us  as its final gift  the power to erase human life from this planet   at such a time in history  we who are free must proclaim anew our faith  this faith is the abiding creed of our fathers  it is our faith in the deathless dignity of man  governed by eternal moral and natural laws   this faith defines our full view of life  it establishes  beyond debate  those gifts of the creator that are man s inalienable rights  and that make all men equal in his sight   in the light of this equality  we know that the virtues most cherished by free people    love of truth  pride of work  devotion to country    all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted  the men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn    all serve as proudly  and as profitably  for america as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws   this faith rules our whole way of life  it decrees that we  the people  elect leaders not to rule but to serve  it asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil  it inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world  and it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant   it is because we  all of us  hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence  upheaval or disorder  rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents  a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a divine providence   the enemies of this faith know no god but force  no devotion but its use  they tutor men in treason  they feed upon the hunger of others  whatever defies them  they torture  especially the truth   here  then  is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies  this conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons  no principle or treasure that we hold  from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital  nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle   freedom is pitted against slavery  lightness against the dark   the faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world  this common bond binds the grower of rice in burma and the planter of wheat in iowa  the shepherd in southern italy and the mountaineer in the andes  it confers a common dignity upon the french soldier who dies in indo china  the british soldier killed in malaya  the american life given in korea   we know  beyond this  that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need  no free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude  for all our own material might  even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories  equally  we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands  this basic law of interdependence  so manifest in the commerce of peace  applies with thousand fold intensity in the event of war   so we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity  their danger  in discord   to produce this unity  to meet the challenge of our time  destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world s leadership   so it is proper that we assure our friends once again that  in the discharge of this responsibility  we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism  between firmness and truculence  between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies   we wish our friends the world over to know this above all  we face the threat    not with dread and confusion    but with confidence and conviction   we feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of history  we are free men  we shall remain free  never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom  a lack of stanch faith   in pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace  we shall be guided by certain fixed principles   these principles are    1  abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us  we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace  for  as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men  so it must be the dedication of their leaders  to save humanity from preying upon itself   in the light of this principle  we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations  so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments  the sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that    in their purpose    they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all  and that    in their result    they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge    2  realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement  we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security  americans  indeed all free men  remember that in the final choice a soldier s pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner s chains    3  knowing that only a united states that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world  we view our nation s strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere  it is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort  the convenience of himself    4  honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world  we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions    5  assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom  we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well being  likewise  we shall count upon them to assume  within the limits of their resources  their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom    6  recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world s peace  we shall strive to foster everywhere  and to practice ourselves  policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade  for the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well being of all other peoples    7  appreciating that economic need  military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples  we hope  within the framework of the united nations  to help strengthen such special bonds the world over  the nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas   in the western hemisphere  we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose   in europe  we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality  only as free europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard  even with our help  its spiritual and cultural heritage    8  conceiving the defense of freedom  like freedom itself  to be one and indivisible  we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor  we reject any insinuation that one race or another  one people or another  is in any sense inferior or expendable    9  respecting the united nations as the living sign of all people s hope for peace  we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force  and in our quest for an honorable peace  we shall neither compromise  nor tire  nor ever cease   by these rules of conduct  we hope to be known to all peoples   by their observance  an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact   this hope    this supreme aspiration    must rule the way we live   we must be ready to dare all for our country  for history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid  we must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose   we must be willing  individually and as a nation  to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us  a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both   these basic precepts are not lofty abstractions  far removed from matters of daily living  they are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength  patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry  moral stamina means more energy and more productivity  on the farm and in the factory  love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible    from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists   and so each citizen plays an indispensable role  the productivity of our heads  our hands  and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command  for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace   no person  no home  no community can be beyond the reach of this call  we are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience  to work with industry  to teach with persuasion  to preach with conviction  to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion  for this truth must be clear before us  whatever america hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of america   the peace we seek  then  is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others  this signifies more than the stilling of guns  easing the sorrow of war  more than escape from death  it is a way of life  more than a haven for the weary  it is a hope for the brave   this is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial  this is the work that awaits us all  to be done with bravery  with charity  and with prayer to almighty god  ',\n",

of the earth  ever speak truth and serve justice   and so shall america    in the sight of all men of good will    prove true to the honorable purposes that bind and rule us as a people in all this time of trial through which we pass   we live in a land of plenty  but rarely has this earth known such peril as today   in our nation work and wealth abound  our population grows  commerce crowds our rivers and rails  our skies  harbors  and highways  our soil is fertile  our agriculture productive  the air rings with the song of our industry    rolling mills and blast furnaces  dynamos  dams  and assembly lines    the chorus of america the bountiful   this is our home    yet this is not the whole of our world  for our world is where our full destiny lies    with men  of all people  and all nations  who are or would be free  and for them    and so for us    this is no time of ease or of rest   in too much of the earth there is want  discord  danger  new forces and new nations stir and strive across the earth  with power to bring  by their fate  great good or great evil to the free world s future  from the deserts of north africa to the islands of the south pacific one third of all mankind has entered upon an historic struggle for a new freedom  freedom from grinding poverty  across all continents  nearly a billion people seek  sometimes almost in desperation  for the skills and knowledge and assistance by which they may satisfy from their own resources  the material wants common to all mankind   no nation  however old or great  escapes this tempest of change and turmoil  some  impoverished by the recent world war  seek to restore their means of livelihood  in the heart of europe  germany still stands tragically divided  so is the whole continent divided  and so  too  is all the world   the divisive force is international communism and the power that it controls   the designs of that power  dark in purpose  are clear in practice  it strives to seal forever the fate of those it has enslaved  it strives to break the ties that unite the free  and it strives to capture    to exploit for its own greater power    all forces of change in the world  especially the needs of the hungry and the hopes of the oppressed   yet the world of international communism has itself been shaken by a fierce and mighty force  the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge their lives to that love  through the night of their bondage  the unconquerable will of heroes has struck with the swift  sharp thrust of lightning  budapest is no longer merely the name of a city  henceforth it is a new and shining symbol of man s yearning to be free   thus across all the globe there harshly blow the winds of change  and  we    though fortunate be our lot    know that we can never turn our backs to them   we look upon this shaken earth  and we declare our firm and fixed purpose    the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails   the building of such a peace is a bold and solemn purpose  to proclaim it is easy  to serve it will be hard  and to attain it  we must be aware of its full meaning    and ready to pay its full price   we know clearly what we seek  and why   we seek peace  knowing that peace is the climate of freedom  and now  as in no other age  we seek it because we have been warned  by the power of modern weapons  that peace may be the only climate possible for human life itself   yet this peace we seek cannot be born of fear alone  it must be rooted in the lives of nations  there must be justice  sensed and shared by all peoples  for  without justice the world can know only a tense and unstable truce  there must be law  steadily invoked and respected by all nations  for without law  the world promises only such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak  but the law of which we speak  comprehending the values of freedom  affirms the equality of all nations  great and small   splendid as can be the blessings of such a peace  high will be its cost  in toil patiently sustained  in help honorably given  in sacrifice calmly borne   we are called to meet the price of this peace   to counter the threat of those who seek to rule by force  we must pay the costs of our own needed military strength  and help to build the security of others   we must use our skills and knowledge and  at times  our substance  to help others rise from misery  however far the scene of suffering may be from our shores  for wherever in the world a people knows desperate want  there must appear at least the spark of hope  the hope of progress    or there will surely rise at last the flames of conflict   we recognize and accept our own deep involvement in the destiny of men everywhere  we are accordingly pledged to honor  and to strive to fortify  the authority of the united nations  for in that body rests the best hope of our age for the assertion of that law by which all nations may live in dignity   and  beyond this general resolve  we are called to act a responsible role in the world s great concerns or conflicts    whether they touch upon the affairs of a vast region  the fate of an island in the pacific  or the use of a canal in the middle east  only in respecting the hopes and cultures of others will we practice the equality of all nations  only as we show willingness and wisdom in giving counsel    in receiving counsel    and in sharing burdens  will we wisely perform the work of peace   for one truth must rule all we think and all we do  no people can live to itself alone  the unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only sure defense  the economic need of all nations    in mutual dependence    makes isolation an impossibility  not even america s prosperity could long survive if other nations did not also prosper  no nation can longer be a fortress  lone and strong and safe  and any people  seeking such shelter for themselves  can now build only their own prison   our pledge to these principles is constant  because we believe in their rightness   we do not fear this world of change  america is no stranger to much of its spirit  everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that america itself has known  the american experiment has  for generations  fired the passion and the courage of millions elsewhere seeking freedom  equality  and opportunity  and the american story of material progress has helped excite the longing of all needy peoples for some satisfaction of their human wants  these hopes that we have helped to inspire  we can help to fulfill   in this confidence  we speak plainly to all peoples   we cherish our friendship with all nations that are or would be free  we respect  no less  their independence  and when  in time of want or peril  they ask our help  they may honorably receive it  for we no more seek to buy their sovereignty than we would sell our own  sovereignty is never bartered among freemen   we honor the aspirations of those nations which  now captive  long for freedom  we seek neither their military alliance nor any artificial imitation of our society  and they can know the warmth of the welcome that awaits them when  as must be  they join again the ranks of freedom   we honor  no less in this divided world than in a less tormented time  the people of russia  we do not dread  rather do we welcome  their progress in education and industry  we wish them success in their demands for more intellectual freedom  greater security before their own laws  fuller enjoyment of the rewards of their own toil  for as such things come to pass  the more certain will be the coming of that day when our peoples may freely meet in friendship   so we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this divided world  thus may the nations cease to live in trembling before the menace of force  thus may the weight of fear and the weight of arms be taken from the burdened shoulders of mankind   this  nothing less  is the labor to which we are called and our strength dedicated   and so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers  to the wide world of our duty and our destiny   may the light of freedom  coming to all darkened lands  flame brightly    until at last the darkness is no more   may the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace  when men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each  the brotherhood of all  ',\n",

forebears l prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago   the world is very different now  for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life  and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe    the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state  but from the hand of god   we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution  let the word go forth from this time and place  to friend and foe alike  that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans    born in this century  tempered by war  disciplined by a hard and bitter peace  proud of our ancient heritage    and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed  and to which we are committed today at home and around the world   let every nation know  whether it wishes us well or ill  that we shall pay any price  bear any burden  meet any hardship  support any friend  oppose any foe  in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty   this much we pledge    and more   to those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share  we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends  united  there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures  divided  there is little we can do    for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder   to those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free  we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny  we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view  but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom    and to remember that  in the past  those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside   to those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery  we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves  for whatever period is required    not because the communists may be doing it  not because we seek their votes  but because it is right  if a free society cannot help the many who are poor  it cannot save the few who are rich   to our sister republics south of our border  we offer a special pledge    to convert our good words into good deeds    in a new alliance for progress    to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty  but this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers  let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas  and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house   to that world assembly of sovereign states  the united nations  our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace  we renew our pledge of support  to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective    to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak    and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run   finally  to those nations who would make themselves our adversary  we offer not a pledge but a request  that both sides begin anew the quest for peace  before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self destruction   we dare not tempt them with weakness  for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed   but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course    both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons  both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom  yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind s final war   so let us begin anew    remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness  and sincerity is always subject to proof  let us never negotiate out of fear  but let us never fear to negotiate   let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us   let both sides  for the first time  formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms    and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations   let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors  together let us explore the stars  conquer the deserts  eradicate disease  tap the ocean depths  and encourage the arts and commerce   let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of isaiah    to  undo the heavy burdens     and to let the oppressed go free    and if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion  let both sides join in creating a new endeavor  not a new balance of power  but a new world of law  where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved   all this will not be finished in the first 100 days  nor will it be finished in the first 1 000 days  nor in the life of this administration  nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet  but let us begin   in your hands  my fellow citizens  more than in mine  will rest the final success or failure of our course  since this country was founded  each generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty  the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globe   now the trumpet summons us again    not as a call to bear arms  though arms we need  not as a call to battle  though embattled we are    but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle  year in and year out   rejoicing in hope  patient in tribulation     a struggle against the common enemies of man  tyranny  poverty  disease  and war itself   can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance  north and south  east and west  that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind  will you join in that historic effort   in the long history of the world  only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger  i do not shrink from this responsibility    i welcome it  i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation  the energy  the faith  the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it    and the glow from that fire can truly light the world   and so  my fellow americans  ask not what your country can do for you    ask what you can do for your country   my fellow citizens of the world  ask not what america will do for you  but what together we can do for the freedom of man   finally  whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world  ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you  with a good conscience our only sure reward  with history the final judge of our deeds  let us go forth to lead the land we love

children just must not go hungry  in a land of healing miracles  neighbors must not suffer and die unattended  in a great land of learning and scholars  young people must be taught to read and write   for the more than 30 years that i have served this nation  i have believed that this injustice to our people  this waste of our resources  was our real enemy  for 30 years or more  with the resources i have had  i have vigilantly fought against it  i have learned  and i know  that it will not surrender easily   but change has given us new weapons  before this generation of americans is finished  this enemy will not only retreat    it will be conquered   justice requires us to remember that when any citizen denies his fellow  saying   his color is not mine   or  his beliefs are strange and different   in that moment he betrays america  though his forebears created this nation    liberty and change liberty was the second article of our covenant  it was self government  it was our bill of rights  but it was more  america would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself  stretching his talents  rejoicing in his work  important in the life of his neighbors and his nation  this has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men  we must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen   the american covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man  and that is today our goal  thus  if as a nation there is much outside our control  as a people no stranger is outside our hope   change has brought new meaning to that old mission  we can never again stand aside  prideful in isolation  terrific dangers and troubles that we once called  foreign  now constantly live among us  if american lives must end  and american treasure be spilled  in countries we barely know  that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant   think of our world as it looks from the rocket that is heading toward mars  it is like a child s globe  hanging in space  the continents stuck to its side like colored maps  we are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth  and each of us  in the span of time  has really only a moment among our companions   how incredible it is that in this fragile existence  we should hate and destroy one another  there are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature  there is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way   our nation s course is abundantly clear  we aspire to nothing that belongs to others  we seek no dominion over our fellow man  but man s dominion over tyranny and misery   but more is required  men want to be a part of a common enterprise    a cause greater than themselves  each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the nation  thus finding new purpose for ourselves  without this  we shall become a nation of strangers    change and the union the third article was union  to those who were small and few against the wilderness  the success of liberty demanded the strength of union  two centuries of change have made this true again  no longer need capitalist and worker  farmer and clerk  city and countryside  struggle to divide our bounty  by working shoulder to shoulder  together we can increase the bounty of all  we have discovered that every child who learns  every man who finds work  every sick body together  like a candle added to an altar    brightens the hope of all the faithful   so let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and to rekindle old hatreds  they stand in the way of a seeking nation   let us now join reason to faith and action to experience  to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose  for the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife  to achieve change without hatred    not without difference of opinion  but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations    the american belief under this covenant of justice  liberty  and union we have become a nation    prosperous  great  and mighty  and we have kept our freedom  but we have no promise from god that our greatness will endure  we have been allowed by him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit  i do not believe that the great society is the ordered  changeless  and sterile battalion of the ants  it is the excitement of becoming    always becoming  trying  probing  falling  resting  and trying again  but always trying and always gaining   in each generation  with toil and tears  we have had to earn our heritage again   if we fail now  we shall have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship  that democracy rests on faith  that freedom asks more than it gives  and that the judgment of god is harshest on those who are most favored   if we succeed  it will not be because of what we have  but it will be because of what we are  not because of what we own  but  rather because of what we believe   for we are a nation of believers  underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day s pursuits  we are believers in justice and liberty and union  and in our own union  we believe that every man must someday be free  and we believe in ourselves   our enemies have always made the same mistake  in my lifetime    in depression and in war    they have awaited our defeat  each time  from the secret places of the american heart  came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine  it brought us victory  and it will again   for this is what america is all about  it is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge  it is the star that is not reached and the harvest sleeping in the unplowed ground  is our world gone  we say  farewell   is a new world coming  we welcome it    and we will bend it to the hopes of man   to these trusted public servants and to my family and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long  winding road  and to all the people of this union and the world  i will repeat today what i said on that sorrowful day in november 1963   i will lead and i will do the best i can    but you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dream  they will lead you best of all   for myself  i ask only  in the words of an ancient leader   give me now wisdom and knowledge  that i may go out and come in before this people  for who can judge this thy people  that is so great      ',\n",
       " 'senator dirksen  mr  chief justice  mr  vice president  president johnson  vice president humphrey  my fellow americans  and my fellow citizens of the world community   i ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment  in the orderly transfer of power  we celebrate the unity that keeps us free   each moment in history is a fleeting time  precious and unique  but some stand out as moments of beginning  in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries   this can be such a moment   forces now are converging that make possible  for the first time  the hope that many of man s deepest aspirations can at last be realized  the spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate  within our own lifetime  advances that once would have taken centuries   in throwing wide the horizons of space  we have discovered new horizons on earth   for the first time  because the people of the world want peace  and the leaders of the world are afraid of war  the times are on the side of peace   eight years from now america will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation  within the lifetime of most people now living  mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years    the beginning of the third millennium   what kind of nation we will be  what kind of world we will live in  whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes  is ours to determine by our actions and our choices   the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker  this honor now beckons america    the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil  and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization   if we succeed  generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment  that we helped make the world safe for mankind   this is our summons to greatness   i believe the american people are ready to answer this call   the second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement  we have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture  we have shared our wealth more broadly than ever  we have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth   we have given freedom new reach  and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white   we see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today  i know america s youth  i believe in them  we can be proud that they are better educated  more committed  more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history   no people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society  or so possessed of the will to achieve it  because our strengths are so great  we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope   standing in this same place a third of a century ago  franklin delano roosevelt addressed a nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear  he could say in surveying the nation s troubles   they concern  thank god  only material things    our crisis today is the reverse   we have found ourselves rich in goods  but ragged in spirit  reaching with magnificent precision for the moon  but falling into raucous discord on earth   we are caught in war  wanting peace  we are torn by division  wanting unity  we see around us empty lives  wanting fulfillment  we see tasks that need doing  waiting for hands to do them   to a crisis of the spirit  we need an answer of the spirit   to find that answer  we need only look within ourselves   when we listen to  the better angels of our nature   we find that they celebrate the simple things  the basic things    such as goodness  decency  love  kindness   greatness comes in simple trappings   the simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us  and cement what unites us   to lower our voices would be a simple thing   in these difficult years  america has suffered from a fever of words  from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver  from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds  from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading   we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another    until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices   for its part  government will listen  we will strive to listen in new ways    to the voices of quiet anguish  the voices that speak without words  the voices of the heart  to the injured voices  the anxious voices  the voices that have despaired of being heard   those who have been left out  we will try to bring in   those left behind  we will help to catch up   for all of our people  we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure   as we reach toward our hopes  our task is to build on what has gone before    not turning away from the old  but turning toward the new   in this past third of a century  government has passed more laws  spent more money  initiated more programs  than in all our previous history   in pursuing our goals of full employment  better housing  excellence in education  in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas  in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life    in all these and more  we will and must pres urgently forward   we shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home   the american dream does not come to those who fall asleep   but we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do   our greatest need now is to reach beyond government  and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed   what has to be done  has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all  the lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing  with the people we can do everything   to match the magnitude of our tasks  we need the energies of our people    enlisted not only in grand enterprises  but more importantly in those small  splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal   with these  we can build a great cathedral of the spirit    each of us raising it one stone at a time  as he reaches out to his neighbor  helping  caring  doing   i do not offer a life of uninspiring ease  i do not call for a life of grim sacrifice  i ask you to join in a high adventure    one as rich as humanity itself  and as exciting as the times we live in   the essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny   until he has been part of a cause larger than himself  no man is truly whole   the way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents  we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use   as we measure what can be done  we shall promise only what we know we can produce  but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams   no man can be fully free while his neighbor is not  to go forward at all is to go forward together   this means black and white together  as one nation  not two  the laws have caught up with our conscience  what remains is to give life to what is in the law  to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before god  all are born equal in dignity before man   as we learn to go forward together at home  let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind   let us take as our goal  where peace is unknown  make it welcome  where peace is fragile  make it strong  where peace is temporary  make it permanent   after a period of confrontation  we are entering an era of negotiation   let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open   we seek an open world    open to ideas  open to the exchange of goods and people    a world in which no people  great or small  will live in angry isolation   we cannot expect to make everyone our friend  but we can try to make no one our enemy   those who would be our adversaries  we invite to a peaceful competition    not in conquering territory or extending dominion  but in enriching the life of man   as we explore the reaches of space  let us go to the new worlds together    not as new worlds to be conquered  but as a new adventure to be shared   with those who are willing to join  let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms  to strengthen the structure of peace  to lift up the poor and the hungry   but to all those who would be tempted by weakness  let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be   over the past twenty years  since i first came to this capital as a freshman congressman  i have visited most of the nations of the world   i have come to know the leaders of the world  and the great forces  the hatreds  the fears that divide the world   i know that peace does not come through wishing for it    that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy   i also know the people of the world   i have seen the hunger of a homeless child  the pain of a man wounded in battle  the grief of a mother who has lost her son  i know these have no ideology  no race   i know america  i know the heart of america is good   i speak from my own heart  and the heart of my country  the deep concern we have for those who suffer  and those who sorrow   i have taken an oath today in the presence of god and my countrymen to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  to that oath i now add this sacred commitment  i shall consecrate my office  my energies  and all the wisdom i can summon  to the cause of peace among nations   let this message be heard by strong and weak alike   the peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people  but the peace that comes  with healing in its wings   with compassion for those who have suffered  with understanding for those who have opposed us  with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny   only a few short weeks ago  we shared the glory of man s first sight of the world as god sees it  as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness   as the apollo astronauts flew over the moon s gray surface on christmas eve  they spoke to us of the beauty of earth    and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance  we heard them invoke god s blessing on its goodness   in that moment  their view from the moon moved poet archibald macleish to write    to see the earth as it truly is  small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats  is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together  brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold    brothers who know now they are truly brothers    in that moment of surpassing technological triumph  men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity    seeing in that far perspective that man s destiny on earth is not divisible  telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos  our destiny lies not in the stars but on earth itself  in our own hands  in our own hearts   we have endured a long night of the american spirit  but as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn  let us not curse the remaining dark  let us gather the light   our destiny offers  not the cup of despair  but the chalice of opportunity  so let us seize it  not in fear  but in gladness    and   riders on the earth together   let us go forward  firm in our faith  steadfast in our purpose  cautious of the dangers  but sustained by our confidence in the will of god and the promise of man  ',\n",
       " 'mr  vice president  mr  speaker  mr  chief justice  senator cook  mrs  eisenhower  and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we share together   when we met here four years ago  america was bleak in spirit  depressed by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home   as we meet here today  we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world   the central question before us is  how shall we use that peace  let us resolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other postwar periods have so often been  a time of retreat and isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad   let us resolve that this will be what it can become  a time of great responsibilities greatly borne  in which we renew the spirit and the promise of america as we enter our third century as a nation   this past year saw far reaching results from our new policies for peace  by continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships  and by our missions to peking and to moscow  we were able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the world  because of america s bold initiatives  1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of world war ii toward a lasting peace in the world   the peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude between wars  but a peace which can endure for generations to come   it is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of america s role in maintaining that peace   unless we in america work to preserve the peace  there will be no peace   unless we in america work to preserve freedom  there will be no freedom   but let us clearly understand the new nature of america s role  as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years   we shall respect our treaty commitments   we shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or rule on another by force   we shall continue  in this era of negotiation  to work for the limitation of nuclear arms  and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great powers   we shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world  but we shall expect others to do their share   the time has passed when america will make every other nation s conflict our own  or make every other nation s future our responsibility  or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs   just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future  we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future   just as america s role is indispensable in preserving the world s peace  so is each nation s role indispensable in preserving its own peace   together with the rest of the world  let us resolve to move forward from the beginnings we have made  let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long  and to build in their place bridges of understanding    so that despite profound differences between systems of government  the people of the world can be friends   let us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as safe as the strong    in which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system    in which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas  and not by the force of their arms   let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden  but gladly    gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a nation can engage  gladly  also  because only if we act greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great nation  and only if we remain a great nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home   we have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better in america    to ensure better education  better health  better housing  better transportation  a cleaner environment    to restore respect for law  to make our communities more livable    and to insure the god given right of every american to full and equal opportunity   because the range of our needs is so great    because the reach of our opportunities is so great    let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in new ways   just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that failed  so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed   abroad  the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our responsibilities  but a better way to peace   and at home  the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities  but a better way to progress   abroad and at home  the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility  we have lived too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in washington   abroad and at home  the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism    of  washington knows best    a person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility  this is human nature  so let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for themselves  to decide more for themselves  let us locate responsibility in more places  let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves   that is why today i offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem  we have lived too long with that false promise  in trusting too much in government  we have asked of it more than it can deliver  this leads only to inflated expectations  to reduced individual effort  and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in what people can do   government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves   let us remember that america was built not by government  but by people    not by welfare  but by work    not by shirking responsibility  but by seeking responsibility   in our own lives  let each of us ask    not just what will government do for me  but what can i do for myself   in the challenges we face together  let each of us ask    not just how can government help  but how can i help   your national government has a great and vital role to play  and i pledge to you that where this government should act  we will act boldly and we will lead boldly  but just as important is the role that each and every one of us must play  as an individual and as a member of his own community   from this day forward  let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart  to bear his responsibility  to do his part  to live his ideals    so that together  we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for america  and together  as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation  we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world   as america s longest and most difficult war comes to an end  let us again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency  and let each of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide    a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one another  a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every american   above all else  the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in america   in recent years  that faith has been challenged   our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country  ashamed of their parents  ashamed of america s record at home and of its role in the world   at every turn  we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with america and little that is right  but i am confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to live   america s record in this century has been unparalleled in the world s history for its responsibility  for its generosity  for its creativity and for its progress   let us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance  more widely shared  than any other system in the history of the world   let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this century  including the one we are now bringing to an end  we have fought not for our selfish advantage  but to help others resist aggression   let us be proud that by our bold  new initiatives  and by our steadfastness for peace with honor  we have made a break through toward creating in the world what the world has not known before    a structure of peace that can last  not merely for our time  but for generations to come   we are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges great as those any nation  or any generation  has ever faced   we shall answer to god  to history  and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years   as i stand in this place  so hallowed by history  i think of others who have stood here before me  i think of the dreams they had for america  and i think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come true   today  i ask your prayers that in the years ahead i may have god s help in making decisions that are right for america  and i pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge   let us pledge together to make these next four years the best four years in america s history  so that on its 200th birthday america will be as young and as vital as when it began  and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world   let us go forward from here confident in hope  strong in our faith in one another  sustained by our faith in god who created us  and striving always to serve his purpose  ',\n",
       " 'for myself and for our nation  i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land   in this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our nation  as my high school teacher  miss julia coleman  used to say   we must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles    here before me is the bible used in the inauguration of our first president  in 1789  and i have just taken the oath of office on the bible my mother gave me a few years ago  opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet micah    he hath showed thee  o man  what is good  and what doth the lord require of thee  but to do justly  and to love mercy  and to walk humbly with thy god    micah 6  8  this inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning  a new dedication within our government  and a new spirit among us all  a president may sense and proclaim that new spirit  but only a people can provide it   two centuries ago our nation s birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom  but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this nation still awaits its consummation  i have no new dream to set forth today  but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream   ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty  it is that unique self  definition which has given us an exceptional appeal  but it also imposes on us a special obligation  to take on those moral duties which  when assumed  seem invariably to be in our own best interests   you have given me a great responsibility  to stay close to you  to be worthy of you  and to exemplify what you are  let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust  your strength can compensate for my weakness  and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes   let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together  confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right   the american dream endures  we must once again have full faith in our country    and in one another  i believe america can be better  we can be even stronger than before   let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our nation  for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future  we recall in special times when we have stood briefly  but magnificently  united  in those times no prize was beyond our grasp   but we cannot dwell upon remembered glory  we cannot afford to drift  we reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person  our government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate   we have already found a high degree of personal liberty  and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity  our commitment to human rights must be absolute  our laws fair  our natural beauty preserved  the powerful must not persecute the weak  and human dignity must be enhanced   we have learned that more is not necessarily better  that even our great nation has its recognized limits  and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems  we cannot afford to do everything  nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future  so  together  in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good  we must simply do our best   our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home  and we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation   to be true to ourselves  we must be true to others  we will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home  for we know that the trust which our nation earns is essential to our strength   the world itself is now dominated by a new spirit  people are more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun    not just for the benefit of their own physical condition  but for basic human rights   the passion for freedom is on the rise  tapping this new spirit  there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for america to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane   we are a strong nation  and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat    a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal  but on the nobility of ideas   we will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable  and we will fight our wars against poverty  ignorance  and injustice    for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled   we are a purely idealistic nation  but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness   because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere  our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights  we do not seek to intimidate  but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people   the world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries  we pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world s armaments to those necessary for each nation s own domestic safety  and we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal    the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth  we urge all other people to join us  for success can mean life instead of death   within us  the people of the united states  there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence  and i join in the hope that when my time as your president has ended  people might say this about our nation  that we had remembered the words of micah and renewed our search for humility  mercy  and justice    that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion  and where there had been mistrust  built unity  with a respect for diversity    that we had found productive work for those able to perform it    that we had strengthened the american family  which is the basi of our society    that we had ensured respect for the law  and equal treatment under the law  for the weak and the powerful  for the rich and the poor    and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own government once again   i would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace  built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values   these are not just my goals  and they will not be my accomplishments  but the affirmation of our nation s continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished  ever expanding american dream  ',\n",

routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are  in the eyes of many in the world  this every 4 year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle   mr  president  i want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition  by your gracious cooperation in the transition process  you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other  and i thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our republic   the business of our nation goes forward  these united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions  we suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history  it distorts our economic decisions  penalizes thrift  and crushes the struggling young and the fixed income elderly alike  it threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people   idle industries have cast workers into unemployment  causing human misery and personal indignity  those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity   but great as our tax burden is  it has not kept pace with public spending  for decades  we have piled deficit upon deficit  mortgaging our future and our children s future for the temporary convenience of the present  to continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social  cultural  political  and economic upheavals   you and i  as individuals  can  by borrowing  live beyond our means  but for only a limited period of time  why  then  should we think that collectively  as a nation  we are not bound by that same limitation   we must act today in order to preserve tomorrow  and let there be no misunderstanding    we are going to begin to act  beginning today   the economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades  they will not go away in days  weeks  or months  but they will go away  they will go away because we  as americans  have the capacity now  as we have had in the past  to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom   in this present crisis  government is not the solution to our problem   from time to time  we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self rule  that government by an elite group is superior to government for  by  and of the people  but if no one among us is capable of governing himself  then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else  all of us together  in and out of government  must bear the burden  the solutions we seek must be equitable  with no one group singled out to pay a higher price   we hear much of special interest groups  our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected  it knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions  and it crosses political party lines  it is made up of men and women who raise our food  patrol our streets  man our mines and our factories  teach our children  keep our homes  and heal us when we are sick    professionals  industrialists  shopkeepers  clerks  cabbies  and truckdrivers  they are  in short   we the people   this breed called americans   well  this administration s objective will be a healthy  vigorous  growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all americans  with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination  putting america back to work means putting all americans back to work  ending inflation means freeing all americans from the terror of runaway living costs  all must share in the productive work of this  new beginning  and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy  with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength  we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world   so  as we begin  let us take inventory  we are a nation that has a government    not the other way around  and this makes us special among the nations of the earth  our government has no power except that granted it by the people  it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed   it is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people  all of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states  the states created the federal government   now  so there will be no misunderstanding  it is not my intention to do away with government  it is  rather  to make it work    work with us  not over us  to stand by our side  not ride on our back  government can and must provide opportunity  not smother it  foster productivity  not stifle it   if we look to the answer as to why  for so many years  we achieved so much  prospered as no other people on earth  it was because here  in this land  we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before  freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth  the price for this freedom at times has been high  but we have never been unwilling to pay that price   it is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government  it is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams  we are not  as some would have us believe  loomed to an inevitable decline  i do not believe in a fate that will all on us no matter what we do  i do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing  so  with all the creative energy at our command  let us begin an era of national renewal  let us renew our determination  our courage  and our strength  and let us renew  our faith and our hope   we have every right to dream heroic dreams  those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes just don t know where to look  you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates  others  a handful in number  produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond  you meet heroes across a counter    and they are on both sides of that counter  there are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs  new wealth and opportunity  they are individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church  charity  culture  art  and education  their patriotism is quiet but deep  their values sustain our national life   i have used the words  they  and  their  in speaking of these heroes  i could say  you  and  your  because i am addressing the heroes of whom i speak    you  the citizens of this blessed land  your dreams  your hopes  your goals are going to be the dreams  the hopes  and the goals of this administration  so help me god   we shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup  how can we love our country and not love our countrymen  and loving them  reach out a hand when they fall  heal them when they are sick  and provide opportunities to make them self  sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory   can we solve the problems confronting us  well  the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic  yes   to paraphrase winston churchill  i did not take the oath i have just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world s strongest economy   in the days ahead i will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity  steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government  progress may be slow    measured in inches and feet  not miles    but we will progress  is it time to reawaken this industrial giant  to get government back within its means  and to lighten our punitive tax burden  and these will be our first priorities  and on these principles  there will be no compromise   on the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the founding fathers  dr  joseph warren  president of the massachusetts congress  said to his fellow americans   our country is in danger  but not to be despaired of     on you depend the fortunes of america  you are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn  act worthy of yourselves    well  i believe we  the americans of today  are ready to act worthy of ourselves  ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves  our children and our children s children   and as we renew ourselves here in our own land  we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world  we will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom   to those neighbors and allies who share our freedom  we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment  we will match loyalty with loyalty  we will strive for mutually beneficial relations  we will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty  for or own sovereignty is not for sale   as for the enemies of freedom  those who are potential adversaries  they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the american people  we will negotiate for it  sacrifice for it  we will not surrender for it    now or ever   our forbearance should never be misunderstood  our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will  when action is required to preserve our national security  we will act  we will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be  knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength   above all  we must realize that no arsenal  or no weapon in the arsenals of the world  is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women  it is a weapon our adversaries in today s world do not have  it is a weapon that we as americans do have  let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors   i am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day  and for that i am deeply grateful  we are a nation under god  and i believe god intended for us to be free  it would be fitting and good  i think  if on each inauguration day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer   this is the first time in history that this ceremony has been held  as you have been told  on this west front of the capitol  standing here  one faces a magnificent vista  opening up on this city s special beauty and history  at the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand   directly in front of me  the monument to a monumental man  george washington  father of our country  a man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly  he led america out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood  off to one side  the stately memorial to thomas jefferson  the declaration of independence flames with his eloquence   and then beyond the reflecting pool the dignified columns of the lincoln memorial  whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of america will find it in the life of abraham lincoln   beyond those monuments to heroism is the potomac river  and on the far shore the sloping hills of arlington national cemetery with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or stars of david  they add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom   each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero i spoke of earlier  their lives ended in places called belleau wood  the argonne  omaha beach  salerno and halfway around the world on guadalcanal  tarawa  pork chop hill  the chosin reservoir  and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called vietnam   under one such marker lies a young man who left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to france with the famed rainbow division  there  on the western front  he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire   we are told that on his body was found a diary  on the flyleaf under the heading   my pledge   he had written these words   america must win this war  therefore  i will work  i will save  i will sacrifice  i will endure  i will fight cheerfully and do my utmost  as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone    the crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that martin treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make  it does require  however  our best effort  and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds  to believe that together  with god s help  we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us   and  after all  why shouldn t we believe that  we are americans  god bless you  and thank you     ',\n",
       " 'senator mathias  chief justice burger  vice president bush  speaker o neill  senator dole  reverend clergy  members of my family and friends  and my fellow citizens   this day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who  for a time  has been absent    senator john stennis   god bless you and welcome back   there is  however  one who is not with us today  representative gillis long of louisiana left us last night  i wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer   moment of silent prayer   amen   there are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you have bestowed on me  i will do my utmost to be deserving of your trust   this is  as senator mathias told us  the 50th time that we the people have celebrated this historic occasion  when the first president  george washington  placed his hand upon the bible  he stood less than a single day s journey by horseback from raw  untamed wilderness  there were 4 million americans in a union of 13 states  today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 states  we have lighted the world with our inventions  gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help  journeyed to the moon and safely returned  so much has changed  and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago   when i took this oath four years ago  i did so in a time of economic stress  voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory  but we  the present day americans  are not given to looking backward  in this blessed land  there is always a better tomorrow   four years ago  i spoke to you of a new beginning and we have accomplished that  but in another sense  our new beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when  for the first time in history  government  the people said  was not our master  it is our servant  its only power that which we the people allow it to have   that system has never failed us  but  for a time  we failed the system  we asked things of government that government was not equipped to give  we yielded authority to the national government that properly belonged to states or to local governments or to the people themselves  we allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase   by 1980  we knew it was time to renew our faith  to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society   we believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams   and we were right to believe that  tax rates have been reduced  inflation cut dramatically  and more people are employed than ever before in our history   we are creating a nation once again vibrant  robust  and alive  but there are many mountains yet to climb  we will not rest until every american enjoys the fullness of freedom  dignity  and opportunity as our birthright  it is our birthright as citizens of this great republic  and we ll meet this challenge   these will be years when americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress  when our values of faith  family  work  and neighborhood were restated for a modern age  when our economy was finally freed from government s grip  when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reduction  rebuilding our defenses  our economy  and developing new technologies  and helped preserve peace in a troubled world  when americans courageously supported the struggle for liberty  self government  and free enterprise throughout the world  and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom   my fellow citizens  our nation is poised for greatness  we must do what we know is right and do it with all our might  let history say of us   these were golden years    when the american revolution was reborn  when freedom gained new life  when america reached for her best    our two party system has served us well over the years  but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as democrats or republicans  but as americans united in a common cause   two of our founding fathers  a boston lawyer named adams and a virginia planter named jefferson  members of that remarkable group who met in independence hall and dared to think they could start the world over again  left us an important lesson  they had become political rivals in the presidential election of 1800  then years later  when both were retired  and age had softened their anger  they began to speak to each other again through letters  a bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours   in 1826  the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence  they both died  they died on the same day  within a few hours of each other  and that day was the fourth of july   in one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives  jefferson wrote   it carries me back to the times when  beset with difficulties and dangers  we were fellow laborers in the same cause  struggling for what is most valuable to man  his right to self government  laboring always at the same oar  with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us  and yet passing harmless    we rode through the storm with heart and hand    well  with heart and hand  let us stand as one today  one people under god determined that our future shall be worthy of our past  as we do  we must not repeat the well intentioned errors of our past  we must never again abuse the trust of working men and women  by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated federal establishment  you elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster  and i don t believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course   at the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth  freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress  we have begun to increase the rewards for work  savings  and investment  reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people s lives   we must simplify our tax system  make it more fair  and bring the rates down for all who work and earn  we must think anew and move with a new boldness  so every american who seeks work can find work  so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things    to be heroes who heal our sick  feed the hungry  protect peace among nations  and leave this world a better place   the time has come for a new american emancipation    a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country  my friends  together we can do this  and do it we must  so help me god     from new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth  a more productive  fulfilled and united people  and a stronger america    an america that will lead the technological revolution  and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature  music  and poetry  and the values of faith  courage  and love   a dynamic economy  with more citizens working and paying taxes  will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits  but an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning  we have come to a turning point  a moment for hard decisions  i have asked the cabinet and my staff a question  and now i put the same question to all of you  if not us  who  and if not now  when  it must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget  we can then begin reducing the national debt   i will shortly submit a budget to the congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year  beyond that  we must take further steps to permanently control government s power to tax and spend  we must act now to protect future generations from government s desire to spend its citizens  money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due  let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government takes in   we have already started returning to the people and to state and local governments responsibilities better handled by them  now  there is a place for the federal government in matters of social compassion  but our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged  and here a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life  where the old and infirm are cared for  the young and  yes  the unborn protected  and the unfortunate looked after and made self  and there is another area where the federal government can play a part  as an older american  i remember a time when people of different race  creed  or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and  yes  in law  there is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we have made toward the  brotherhood of man  that god intended for us  let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an america rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens   let us resolve that we the people will build an american opportunity society in which all of us    white and black  rich and poor  young and old    will go forward together arm in arm  again  let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the earth  we are all americans pledged to carry on this last  best hope of man on earth   i have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which we should put on our national government  now let me turn to a task which is the primary responsibility of national government    the safety and security of our people   today  we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on earth  yet history has shown that peace will not come  nor will our freedom be preserved  by good will alone  there are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom  one nation  the soviet union  has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man  building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons   we have made progress in restoring our defense capability  but much remains to be done  there must be no wavering by us  nor any doubts by others  that america will meet her responsibilities to remain free  secure  and at peace   there is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security  and that is to reduce the need for it  and this we are trying to do in negotiations with the soviet union  we are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons  we seek  instead  to reduce their number  we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth   now  for decades  we and the soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction  if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons  the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it  is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people  our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs   i have approved a research program to find  if we can  a security shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target  it wouldn t kill people  it would destroy weapons  it wouldn t militarize space  it would help demilitarize the arsenals of earth  it would render nuclear weapons obsolete  we will meet with the soviets  hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction   we strive for peace and security  heartened by the changes all around us  since the turn of the century  the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold  human freedom is on the march  and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere  freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit  people  worldwide  hunger for the right of self determination  for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress   america must remain freedom s staunchest friend  for freedom is our best ally   and it is the world s only hope  to conquer poverty and preserve peace  every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war  every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace   so we go forward today  a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose  with our alliances strengthened  with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion  we look forward to a world rich in possibilities  and all this because we have worked and acted together  not as members of political parties  but as americans   my friends  we live in a world that is lit by lightning  so much is changing and will change  but so much endures  and transcends time   history is a ribbon  always unfurling  history is a journey  and as we continue our journey  we think of those who traveled before us  we stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy    or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn t gotten so cold  now we are standing inside this symbol of our democracy  now we hear again the echoes of our past  a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of valley forge  a lonely president paces the darkened halls  and ponders his struggle to preserve the union  the men of the alamo call out encouragement to each other  a settler pushes west and sings a song  and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air   it is the american sound  it is hopeful  big hearted  idealistic  daring  decent  and fair  that s our heritage  that is our song  we sing it still  for all our problems  our differences  we are together as of old  as we raise our voices to the god who is the author of this most tender music  and may he continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound    sound in unity  affection  and love    one people under god  dedicated to the dream of freedom that he has placed in the human heart  called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world   god bless you and may god bless america     ',\n",

here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history  president reagan  on behalf of our nation  i thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for america   i have just repeated word for word the oath taken by george washington 200 years ago  and the bible on which i placed my hand is the bible on which he placed his  it is right that the memory of washington be with us today  not only because this is our bicentennial inauguration  but because washington remains the father of our country  and he would  i think  be gladdened by this day  for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact  our continuity these 200 years since our government began   we meet on democracy s front porch  a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends  for this is a day when our nation is made whole  when our differences  for a moment  are suspended   and my first act as president is a prayer  i ask you to bow your heads   heavenly father  we bow our heads and thank you for your love  accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely  make us strong to do your work  willing to heed and hear your will  and write on our hearts these words   use power to help people   for we are given power not to advance our own purposes  nor to make a great show in the world  nor a name  there is but one just use of power  and it is to serve people  help us to remember it  lord  amen   i come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with promise  we live in a peaceful  prosperous time  but we can make it better  for a new breeze is blowing  and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn  for in man s heart  if not in fact  the day of the dictator is over  the totalitarian era is passing  its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient  lifeless tree  a new breeze is blowing  and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on  there is new ground to be broken  and new action to be taken  there are times when the future seems thick as a fog  you sit and wait  hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path  but this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow   great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom  men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity  the people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows   we know what works  freedom works  we know what s right  freedom is right  we know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on earth  through free markets  free speech  free elections  and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state   for the first time in this century  for the first time in perhaps all history  man does not have to invent a system by which to live  we don t have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better  we don t have to wrest justice from the kings  we only have to summon it from within ourselves  we must act on what we know  i take as my guide the hope of a saint  in crucial things  unity  in important things  diversity  in all things  generosity   america today is a proud  free nation  decent and civil  a place we cannot help but love  we know in our hearts  not loudly and proudly  but as a simple fact  that this country has meaning beyond what we see  and that our strength is a force for good  but have we changed as a nation even in our time  are we enthralled with material things  less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice   my friends  we are not the sum of our possessions  they are not the measure of our lives  in our hearts we know what matters  we cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car  a bigger bank account  we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend  a loving parent  a citizen who leaves his home  his neighborhood and town better than he found it  what do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there  that we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us  or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better  and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship   no president  no government  can teach us to remember what is best in what we are  but if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference  if he can celebrate the quieter  deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk  but of better hearts and finer souls  if he can do these things  then he must   america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle  we as a people have such a purpose today  it is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world  my friends  we have work to do  there are the homeless  lost and roaming  there are the children who have nothing  no love  no normalcy  there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction    drugs  welfare  the demoralization that rules the slums  there is crime to be conquered  the rough crime of the streets  there are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can t care for and might not love  they need our care  our guidance  and our education  though we bless them for choosing life   the old solution  the old way  was to think that public money alone could end these problems  but we have learned that is not so  and in any case  our funds are low  we have a deficit to bring down  we have more will than wallet  but will is what we need  we will make the hard choices  looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently  making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety  and then we will do the wisest thing of all  we will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows    the goodness and the courage of the american people   i am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others  a new activism  hands on and involved  that gets the job done  we must bring in the generations  harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young  for not only leadership is passed from generation to generation  but so is stewardship  and the generation born after the second world war has come of age   i have spoken of a thousand points of light  of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation  doing good  we will work hand in hand  encouraging  sometimes leading  sometimes being led  rewarding  we will work on this in the white house  in the cabinet agencies  i will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light  and i will ask every member of my government to become involved  the old ideas are new again because they are not old  they are timeless  duty  sacrifice  commitment  and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in   we need a new engagement  too  between the executive and the congress  the challenges before us will be thrashed out with the house and the senate  we must bring the federal budget into balance  and we must ensure that america stands before the world united  strong  at peace  and fiscally sound  but  of course  things may be difficult  we need compromise  we have had dissension  we need harmony  we have had a chorus of discordant voices   for congress  too  has changed in our time  there has grown a certain divisiveness  we have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other s ideas are challenged  but each other s motives  and our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other  it has been this way since vietnam  that war cleaves us still  but  friends  that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago  and surely the statute of limitations has been reached  this is a fact  the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory  a new breeze is blowing  and the old bipartisanship must be made new again   to my friends    and yes  i do mean friends    in the loyal opposition    and yes  i mean loyal  i put out my hand  i am putting out my hand to you  mr  speaker  i am putting out my hand to you mr  majority leader  for this is the thing  this is the age of the offered hand  we can t turn back clocks  and i don t want to  but when our fathers were young  mr  speaker  our differences ended at the water s edge  and we don t wish to turn back time  but when our mothers were young  mr  majority leader  the congress and the executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live  let us negotiate soon and hard  but in the end  let us produce  the american people await action  they didn t send us here to bicker  they ask us to rise above the merely partisan   in crucial things  unity     and this  my friends  is crucial   to the world  too  we offer new engagement and a renewed vow  we will stay strong to protect the peace  the  offered hand  is a reluctant fist  but once made  strong  and can be used with great effect  there are today americans who are held against their will in foreign lands  and americans who are unaccounted for  assistance can be shown here  and will be long remembered  good will begets good will  good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on   great nations like great men must keep their word  when america says something  america means it  whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps  we will always try to speak clearly  for candor is a compliment  but subtlety  too  is good and has its place  while keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong  ever strong  we will continue the new closeness with the soviet union  consistent both with our security and with progress  one might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience  but hope is good  and so are strength and vigilance   here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled  but my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by  and the women who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns  i don t mean this to be sentimental  i mean that on days like this  we remember that we are all part of a continuum  inescapably connected by the ties that bind   our children are watching in schools throughout our great land  and to them i say  thank you for watching democracy s big day  for democracy belongs to us all  and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze  and to all i say  no matter what your circumstances or where you are  you are part of this day  you are part of the life of our great nation   a president is neither prince nor pope  and i don t seek a window on men s souls  in fact  i yearn for a greater tolerance  an easy  goingness about each other s attitudes and way of life   there are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance  the most obvious now is drugs  and when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship  it may as well have been a deadly bacteria  so much has it hurt the body  the soul of our country  and there is much to be done and to be said  but take my word for it  this scourge will stop   and so  there is much to do  and tomorrow the work begins  i do not mistrust the future  i do not fear what is ahead  for our problems are large  but our heart is larger  our challenges are great  but our will is greater  and if our flaws are endless  god s love is truly boundless   some see leadership as high drama  and the sound of trumpets calling  and sometimes it is that  but i see history as a book with many pages  and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning  the new breeze blows  a page turns  the story unfolds  and so today a chapter begins  a small and stately story of unity  diversity  and generosity    shared  and written  together   thank you  god bless you and god bless the united states of america     ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens  today we celebrate the mystery of american renewal  this ceremony is held in the depth of winter  but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world  we force the spring  a spring reborn in the world s oldest democracy  that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent america  when our founders boldly declared america s independence to the world  and our purposes to the almighty  they knew that america  to endure  would have to change  not change for change sake  but change to preserve america s ideals  life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness   though we march to the music of our time  our mission is timeless  each generation of american s must define what it means to be an american  on behalf of our nation  i salute my predecessor  president bush  for his half century of service to america and i thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression  fascism and communism   today  a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom  but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues  raised in unrivalled prosperity  we inherit an economy that is still the world s strongest  but is weakened by business failures  stagnant wages  increasing inequality  and deep divisions among our own people   when george washington first took the oath i have just sworn to uphold  news travelled slowly across the land by horseback  and across the ocean by boat  now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously tobillions around the world  communications and commerce are global  investment is mobile  technology is almost magical  and ambition for a better life is now universal   we earn our livelihood in america today in peaceful competition with people all across the earth  profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world  and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy  this new world has already enriched the lives of millions of americans who are able to compete and win in it  but when most people are working harder for less  when others cannot work at all  when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises  great and small  when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom  and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead  we have not made change our friend   we know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps  but we have not done so  instead we have drifted  and that drifting has eroded our resources  fractured our economy  and shaken our confidence  though our challenges are fearsome  so are our strengths  americans have ever been a restless  questing  hopeful people  and we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us  from our revolution to the civil war  to the great depression  to the civil rights movement  our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history  thomas jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time  well  my fellow americans  this is our time  let us embrace it   our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal  there is nothing wrong with america that cannot be cured by what is right with america   and so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift  and a new season of american renewal has begun   to renew america we must be bold  we must do what no generation has had to do before  we must invest more in our own people  in their jobs  and in their future  and at the same time cut our massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity  it will not be easy  it will require sacrifice  but it can be done  and done fairly  not choosing sacrifice for its own sake  but for our own sake   we must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children  our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity  we can do no less  anyone who has ever watched a child s eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is  posterity is the world to come  the world for whom we hold our ideals  from whom we have borrowed our planet  and to whom we bear sacred responsibilities  we must do what america does best  offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all   it is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing  from our government  or from each other  let us all take more responsibility  not only for ourselves and our families  but for our communities and our country  to renew america we must revitalize our democracy  this beautiful capitol  like every capitol since the dawn of civilization  is often a place of intrigue and calculation  powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out  who is up and who is down  forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way   americans deserve better  and in this city today there are people who want to do better  and so i say to all of you here  let us resolve to reform our politics  so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people  let us put aside personal advantage  so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of america  let us resolve to make our government a place for what franklin roosevelt called  bold  persistent experimentation  a government for our tomorrows  not our yesterdays   let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it belongs   to renew america we must meet challenges abroad  as well as at home  there is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic  the world economy  the world environment  the world aids crisis  the world arms race  they affect us all  today as an old order passes  the new world is more free  but less stable  communism s collapse has called forth old animosities  and new dangers  clearly  america must continue to lead the world we did so much to make  while america rebuilds at home  we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world   together with our friends and allies  we will work together to shape change  lest it engulf us  when our vital interests are challenged  or the will and conscience of the international community is defied  we will act  with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible  with force when necessary  the brave americans serving our nation today in the persian gulf  in somalia  and wherever else they stand  are testament to our resolve  but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas  which are still new in many lands  across the world  we see them embraced and we rejoice  our hopes  our hearts  our hands  are with those on every continent  who are building democracy and freedom  their cause is america s cause  the american people have summoned the change we celebrate today  you have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus  you have cast your votes in historic numbers  you have changed the face of congress  the presidency  and the political process itself  yes  you  my fellow americans  have forced the spring  now we must do the work the season demands  to that work i now turn with all the authority of my office  i ask the congress to join with me  but no president  no congress  no government can undertake this mission alone   my fellow americans  you  too  must play your part in our renewal  i challenge a new generation of young americans to a season of service  to act on your idealism  by helping troubled children  keeping company with those in need  reconnecting our torn communities  there is so much to be done  enough  indeed  for millions of others who are still young in spirit  to give of themselves in service  too  in serving we recognize a simple  but powerful  truth  we need each other  and we must care for one another  today we do more than celebrate america  we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of america  an idea born in revolution  and renewed through two centuries of challenge  an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate  we  the fortunate and the unfortunate  might have been each other  an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity  the deepest measure of unity  an idea infused with the conviction that america s journey long  heroic journey must go forever upward   and so  my fellow americans  as we stand at the edge of the 21st century  let us begin anew  with energy and hope  with faith and discipline  and let us work until our work is done  the scripture says   and let us not be weary in well doing  for in due season we shall reap  if we faint not   from this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley  we have heard the trumpets  we have changed the guard  and now each in our own way  and with god s help  we must answer the call   thank you  and god bless you all     ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens  at this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century  let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century  it is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century  in a new millennium  but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs    a moment that will define our course  and our character  for decades to come  we must keep our old democracy forever young  guided by the ancient vision of a promised land  let us set our sights upon a land of new promise    the promise of america was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal  it was extended and preserved in the 19th century  when our nation spread across the continent  saved the union  and abolished the awful scourge of slavery    then  in turmoil and triumph  that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the american century    and what a century it has been  america became the world s mightiest industrial power  saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war  and time and again  reached out across the globe to millions who  like us  longed for the blessings of liberty    along the way  americans produced a great middle class and security in old age  built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all  split the atom and explored the heavens  invented the computer and the microchip  and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for african americans and all minorities  and extending the circle of citizenship  opportunity and dignity to women    now  for the third time  a new century is upon us  and another time to choose  we began the 19th century with a choice  to spread our nation from coast to coast  we began the 20th century with a choice  to harness the industrial revolution to our values of free enterprise  conservation  and human decency  those choices made all the difference  at the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society  to unleash the limitless potential of all our people  and  yes  to form a more perfect union    when last we gathered  our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today  we vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation    in these four years  we have been touched by tragedy  exhilarated by challenge  strengthened by achievement  america stands alone as the world s indispensable nation  once again  our economy is the strongest on earth  once again  we are building stronger families  thriving communities  better educational opportunities  a cleaner environment  problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts  our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work    and once again  we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government  today we can declare  government is not the problem  and government is not the solution  we    the american people    we are the solution  our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries  flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day    as times change  so government must change  we need a new government for a new century    humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us  but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves  a government that is smaller  lives within its means  and does more with less  yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world  and where it can give americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives  government should do more  not less  the preeminent mission of our new government is to give all americans an opportunity    not a guarantee  but a real opportunity    to build better lives    beyond that  my fellow citizens  the future is up to us  our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship  and we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century  there is work to do  work that government alone cannot do  teaching children to read  hiring people off welfare rolls  coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime  taking time out of our own lives to serve others    each and every one of us  in our own way  must assume personal responsibility    not only for ourselves and our families  but for our neighbors and our nation  our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century  for any one of us to succeed  we must succeed as one america    the challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future    will we be one nation  one people  with one common destiny  or not  will we all come together  or come apart    the divide of race has been america s constant curse  and each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices  prejudice and contempt  cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different  these forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past  they plague us still  they fuel the fanaticism of terror  and they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world    these obsessions cripple both those who hate and  of course  those who are hated  robbing both of what they might become  we cannot  we will not  succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere  we shall overcome them  and we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another    our rich texture of racial  religious and political diversity will be a godsend in the 21st century  great rewards will come to those who can live together  learn together  work together  forge new ties that bind together    as this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines  ten years ago  the internet was the mystical province of physicists  today  it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren  scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life  cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand    the world is no longer divided into two hostile camps  instead  now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries  growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over  and for the very first time in all of history  more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship    my fellow americans  as we look back at this remarkable century  we may ask  can we hope not just to follow  but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in america and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy  to that question  every american here and every american in our land today must answer a resounding  yes     this is the heart of our task  with a new vision of government  a new sense of responsibility  a new spirit of community  we will sustain america s journey  the promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise    in this new land  education will be every citizen s most prized possession  our schools will have the highest standards in the world  igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy  and the doors of higher education will be open to all  the knowledge and power of the information age will be within reach not just of the few  but of every classroom  every library  every child  parents and children will have time not only to work  but to read and play together  and the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home  a better job  the certain chance to go to college    our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children  because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore  everyone who can work  will work  with today s permanent under class part of tomorrow s growing middle class  new miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now  but the children and hardworking families too long denied    we will stand mighty for peace and freedom  and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction  our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear  chemical or biological weapons  ports and airports  farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas  and the world s greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies    our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations    a nation that balances its budget  but never loses the balance of its values  a nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care  and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time  a nation that fortifies the world s most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water  air  and majestic land    and in this land of new promise  we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests    regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all americans    fellow citizens  let us build that america  a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens  prosperity and power    yes  they are important  and we must maintain them  but let us never forget  the greatest progress we have made  and the greatest progress we have yet to make  is in the human heart  in the end  all the world s wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit    thirty four years ago  the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there  at the other end of this mall  in words that moved the conscience of a nation  like a prophet of old  he told of his dream that one day america would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart  martin luther king s dream was the american dream  his quest is our quest  the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed  our history has been built on such dreams and labors  and by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of america in the 21st century    to that effort i pledge all my strength and every power of my office  i ask the members of congress here to join in that pledge  the american people returned to office a president of one party and a congress of another  surely  they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore  no  they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach  and to move on with america s mission    america demands and deserves big things from us    and nothing big ever came from being small  let us remember the timeless wisdom of cardinal bernardin  when facing the end of his own life  he said   it is wrong to waste the precious gift of time  on acrimony and division     fellow citizens  we must not waste the precious gift of this time  for all of us are on that same journey of our lives  and our journey  too  will come to an end  but the journey of our america must go on    and so  my fellow americans  we must be strong  for there is much to dare  the demands of our time are great and they are different  let us meet them with faith and courage  with patience and a grateful and happy heart  let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history  yes  let us build our bridge  a bridge wide enough and strong enough for every american to cross over to a blessed land of new promise    may those generations whose faces we cannot yet see  whose names we may never know  say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the american dream alive for all her children  with the american promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people  with america s bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world    from the height of this place and the summit of this century  let us go forth  may god strengthen our hands for the good work ahead    and always  always bless our america      ',\n",
       " 'president clinton  distinguished guests and my fellow citizens  the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history  yet common in our country  with a simple oath  we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings   as i begin  i thank president clinton for his service to our nation    and i thank vice president gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace    i am honored and humbled to stand here  where so many of america s leaders have come before me  and so many will follow   we have a place  all of us  in a long story  a story we continue  but whose end we will not see  it is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old  a story of a slave holding society that became a servant of freedom  the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess  to defend but not to conquer   it is the american story  a story of flawed and fallible people  united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals    the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs  that everyone deserves a chance  that no insignificant person was ever born    americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws  and though our nation has sometimes halted  and sometimes delayed  we must follow no other course    through much of the last century  america s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea  now it is a seed upon the wind  taking root in many nations    our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country  it is the inborn hope of our humanity  an ideal we carry but do not own  a trust we bear and pass along  and even after nearly 225 years  we have a long way yet to travel    while many of our citizens prosper  others doubt the promise  even the justice  of our own country  the ambitions of some americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth  and sometimes our differences run so deep  it seems we share a continent  but not a country    we do not accept this  and we will not allow it  our unity  our union  is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation  and this is my solemn pledge  i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity    i know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in his image    and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward   america has never been united by blood or birth or soil  we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds  lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens  every child must be taught these principles  every citizen must uphold them  and every immigrant  by embracing these ideals  makes our country more  not less  american    today  we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation s promise through civility  courage  compassion and character    america  at its best  matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility  a civil society demands from each of us good will and respect  fair dealing and forgiveness    some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because  in a time of peace  the stakes of our debates appear small    but the stakes for america are never small  if our country does not lead the cause of freedom  it will not be led  if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character  we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism  if we permit our economy to drift and decline  the vulnerable will suffer most    we must live up to the calling we share  civility is not a tactic or a sentiment  it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism  of community over chaos  and this commitment  if we keep it  is a way to shared accomplishment    america  at its best  is also courageous    our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war  when defending common dangers defined our common good  now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us  we must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations    together  we will reclaim america s schools  before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives    we will reform social security and medicare  sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent  and we will reduce taxes  to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working americans    we will build our defenses beyond challenge  lest weakness invite challenge    we will confront weapons of mass destruction  so that a new century is spared new horrors    the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake  america remains engaged in the world by history and by choice  shaping a balance of power that favors freedom  we will defend our allies and our interests  we will show purpose without arrogance  we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength  and to all nations  we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth    america  at its best  is compassionate  in the quiet of american conscience  we know that deep  persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation s promise    and whatever our views of its cause  we can agree that children at risk are not at fault  abandonment and abuse are not acts of god  they are failures of love    and the proliferation of prisons  however necessary  is no substitute for hope and order in our souls    where there is suffering  there is duty  americans in need are not strangers  they are citizens  not problems  but priorities  and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless    government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health  for civil rights and common schools  yet compassion is the work of a nation  not just a government    and some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor s touch or a pastor s prayer  church and charity  synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity  and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws    many in our country do not know the pain of poverty  but we can listen to those who do    and i can pledge our nation to a goal  when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho  we will not pass to the other side    america  at its best  is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected    encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats  it is a call to conscience  and though it requires sacrifice  it brings a deeper fulfillment  we find the fullness of life not only in options  but in commitments  and we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free    our public interest depends on private character  on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness  on uncounted  unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom    sometimes in life we are called to do great things  but as a saint of our times has said  every day we are called to do small things with great love  the most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone    i will live and lead by these principles  to advance my convictions with civility  to pursue the public interest with courage  to speak for greater justice and compassion  to call for responsibility and try to live it as well    in all these ways  i will bring the values of our history to the care of our times    what you do is as important as anything government does  i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort  to defend needed reforms against easy attacks  to serve your nation  beginning with your neighbor  i ask you to be citizens  citizens  not spectators  citizens  not subjects  responsible citizens  building communities of service and a nation of character    americans are generous and strong and decent  not because we believe in ourselves  but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves  when this spirit of citizenship is missing  no government program can replace it  when this spirit is present  no wrong can stand against it    after the declaration of independence was signed  virginia statesman john page wrote to thomas jefferson   we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong  do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm     much time has passed since jefferson arrived for his inauguration  the years and changes accumulate  but the themes of this day he would know  our nation s grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity    we are not this story s author  who fills time and eternity with his purpose  yet his purpose is achieved in our duty  and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another    never tiring  never yielding  never finishing  we renew that purpose today  to make our country more just and generous  to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life    this work continues  this story goes on  and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm    god bless you all  and god bless america      ',\n",

a mortal threat  there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment  and expose the pretensions of tyrants  and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant  and that is the force of human freedom    we are led  by events and common sense  to one conclusion  the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands  the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world    america  s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one  from the day of our founding  we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights  and dignity  and matchless value  because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth  across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self government  because no one is fit to be a master  and no one deserves to be a slave  advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation  it is the honorable achievement of our fathers  now it is the urgent requirement of our nation  s security  and the calling of our time    so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture  with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world    this is not primarily the task of arms  though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary  freedom  by its nature  must be chosen  and defended by citizens  and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities  and when the soul of a nation finally speaks  the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own  america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling  our goal instead is to help others find their own voice  attain their own freedom  and make their own way    the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations  the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it  america  s influence is not unlimited  but fortunately for the oppressed  america  s influence is considerable  and we will use it confidently in freedom  s cause    my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats  some have unwisely chosen to test america  s resolve  and have found it firm    we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation  the moral choice between oppression  which is always wrong  and freedom  which is eternally right  america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains  or that women welcome humiliation and servitude  or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies    we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people  america  s belief in human dignity will guide our policies  yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators  they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed  in the long run  there is no justice without freedom  and there can be no human rights without human liberty    some  i know  have questioned the global appeal of liberty xthough this time in history  four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen  is an odd time for doubt  americans  of all people  should never be surprised by the power of our ideals  eventually  the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul  we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery  liberty will come to those who love it    today  america speaks anew to the peoples of the world    all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know  the united states will not ignore your oppression  or excuse your oppressors  when you stand for your liberty  we will stand with you    democratic reformers facing repression  prison  or exile can know  america sees you for who you are  the future leaders of your free country    the rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln did    those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves  and  under the rule of a just god  cannot long retain it      the leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know  to serve your people you must learn to trust them  start on this journey of progress and justice  and america will walk at your side    and all the allies of the united states can know  we honor your friendship  we rely on your counsel  and we depend on your help  division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom  s enemies  the concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies   defeat    today  i also speak anew to my fellow citizens    from all of you  i have asked patience in the hard task of securing america  which you have granted in good measure  our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill  and would be dishonorable to abandon  yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation  tens of millions have achieved their freedom  and as hope kindles hope  millions more will find it  by our efforts  we have lit a fire as well xa fire in the minds of men  it warms those who feel its power  it burns those who fight its progress  and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world    a few americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause xin the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy  k the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments  k the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies  some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives xand we will always honor their names and their sacrifice    all americans have witnessed this idealism  and some for the first time  i ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes  you have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers  you have seen that life is fragile  and evil is real  and courage triumphs  make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants  larger than yourself xand in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country  but to its character    america has need of idealism and courage  because we have essential work at home xthe unfinished work of american freedom  in a world moving toward liberty  we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty    in america  s ideal of freedom  citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence  instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence  this is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the homestead act  the social security act  and the g i  bill of rights  and now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time  to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country  we will bring the highest standards to our schools  and build an ownership society  we will widen the ownership of homes and businesses  retirement savings and health insurance xpreparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society  by making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny  we will give our fellow americans greater freedom from want and fear  and make our society more prosperous and just and equal    in america  s ideal of freedom  the public interest depends on private character xon integrity  and tolerance toward others  and the rule of conscience in our own lives  self government relies  in the end  on the governing of the self  that edifice of character is built in families  supported by communities with standards  and sustained in our national life by the truths of sinai  the sermon on the mount  the words of the koran  and the varied faiths of our people  americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before xideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday  today  and forever    in america  s ideal of freedom  the exercise of rights is ennobled by service  and mercy  and a heart for the weak  liberty for all does not mean independence from one another  our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love  americans  at our best  value the life we see in one another  and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth  and our country must abandon all the habits of racism  because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time    from the perspective of a single day  including this day of dedication  the issues and questions before our country are many  from the viewpoint of centuries  the questions that come to us are narrowed and few  did our generation advance the cause of freedom  and did our character bring credit to that cause    these questions that judge us also unite us  because americans of every party and background  americans by choice and by birth  are bound to one another in the cause of freedom  we have known divisions  which must be healed to move forward in great purposes xand i will strive in good faith to heal them  yet those divisions do not define america  we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack  and our response came like a single hand over a single heart  and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good  and the victims of disaster are given hope  and the unjust encounter justice  and the captives are set free    we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom  not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability  it is human choices that move events  not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation  god moves and chooses as he wills  we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind  the hunger in dark places  the longing of the soul  when our founders declared a new order of the ages  when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty  when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner   freedom now   xthey were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled  history has an ebb and flow of justice  but history also has a visible direction  set by liberty and the author of liberty    when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration  a witness said    it rang as if it meant something    in our time it means something still  america  in this young century  proclaims liberty throughout all the world  and to all the inhabitants thereof  renewed in our strength xtested  but not weary xwe are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom    may god bless you  and may he watch over the united states of america  ',\n",
       " 'my fellow citizens   i stand here today humbled by the task before us  grateful for the trust you have bestowed  mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors  i thank president bush for his service to our nation  as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition   forty four americans have now taken the presidential oath  the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace  yet  every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms  at these moments  america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office  but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers  and true to our founding documents   so it has been  so it must be with this generation of americans   that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood  our nation is at war  against a far reaching network of violence and hatred  our economy is badly weakened  a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some  but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age  homes have been lost  jobs shed  businesses shuttered  our health care is too costly  our schools fail too many  and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet   these are the indicators of crisis  subject to data and statistics  less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land    a nagging fear that america s decline is inevitable  that the next generation must lower its sights   today i say to you that the challenges we face are real  they are serious and they are many  they will not be met easily or in a short span of time  but know this  america    they will be met   on this day  we gather because we have chosen hope over fear  unity of purpose over conflict and discord   on this day  we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises  the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics   we remain a young nation  but in the words of scripture  the time has come to set aside childish things  the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit  to choose our better history  to carry forward that precious gift  that noble idea  passed on from generation to generation  the god given promise that all are equal  all are free  and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness   in reaffirming the greatness of our nation  we understand that greatness is never a given  it must be earned  our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less  it has not been the path for the faint hearted    for those who prefer leisure over work  or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame  rather  it has been the risk takers  the doers  the makers of things some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor  who have carried us up the long  rugged path towards prosperity and freedom   for us  they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life   for us  they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west  endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth   for us  they fought and died  in places like concord and gettysburg  normandy and khe sahn   time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life  they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions  greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction   this is the journey we continue today  we remain the most prosperous  powerful nation on earth  our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began  our minds are no less inventive  our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year  our capacity remains undiminished  but our time of standing pat  of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions    that time has surely passed  starting today  we must pick ourselves up  dust ourselves off  and begin again the work of remaking america   for everywhere we look  there is work to be done  the state of our economy calls for action  bold and swift  and we will act    not only to create new jobs  but to lay a new foundation for growth  we will build the roads and bridges  the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together  we will restore science to its rightful place  and wield technology s wonders to raise health care s quality and lower its cost  we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories  and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age  all this we can do  all this we will do   now  there are some who question the scale of our ambitions    who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans  their memories are short  for they have forgotten what this country has already done  what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose  and necessity to courage   what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them    that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply  the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small  but whether it works    whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage  care they can afford  a retirement that is dignified  where the answer is yes  we intend to move forward  where the answer is no  programs will end  and those of us who manage the public s dollars will be held to account    to spend wisely  reform bad habits  and do our business in the light of day    because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government   nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill  its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched  but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye  the market can spin out of control    the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous  the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product  but on the reach of our prosperity  on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart    not out of charity  but because it is the surest route to our common good   as for our common defense  we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals  our founding fathers  faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine  drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man  a charter expanded by the blood of generations  those ideals still light the world  and we will not give them up for expedience s sake  and so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today  from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born  know that america is a friend of each nation and every man  woman  and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity  and we are ready to lead once more   recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks  but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions  they understood that our power alone cannot protect us  nor does it entitle us to do as we please  instead  they knew that our power grows through its prudent use  our security emanates from the justness of our cause  the force of our example  the tempering qualities of humility and restraint   we are the keepers of this legacy  guided by these principles once more  we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort    even greater cooperation and understanding between nations  we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people  and forge a hard earned peace in afghanistan  with old friends and former foes  we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat  and roll back the specter of a warming planet  we will not apologize for our way of life  nor will we waver in its defense  and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents  we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken  you cannot outlast us  and we will defeat you   for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength  not a weakness  we are a nation of christians and muslims  jews and hindus    and non believers  we are shaped by every language and culture  drawn from every end of this earth  and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation  and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united  we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass  that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve  that as the world grows smaller  our common humanity shall reveal itself  and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace   to the muslim world  we seek a new way forward  based on mutual interest and mutual respect  to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict  or blame their society s ills on the west    know that your people will judge you on what you can build  not what you destroy  to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent  know that you are on the wrong side of history  but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist   to the people of poor nations  we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow  to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds  and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty  we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders  nor can we consume the world s resources without regard to effect  for the world has changed  and we must change with it   as we consider the road that unfolds before us  we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who  at this very hour  patrol far off deserts and distant mountains  they have something to tell us  just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages  we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty  but because they embody the spirit of service  a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves  and yet  at this moment    a moment that will define a generation    it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all   for as much as government can do and must do  it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies  it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break  the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours  it is the firefighter s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke  but also a parent s willingness to nurture a child  that finally decides our fate    our challenges may be new  the instruments with which we meet them may be new  but those values upon which our success depends    honesty and hard work  courage and fair play  tolerance and curiosity  loyalty and patriotism    these things are old  these things are true  they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history  what is demanded then is a return to these truths  what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility    a recognition  on the part of every american  that we have duties to ourselves  our nation  and the world  duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly  firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit  so defining of our character  than giving our all to a difficult task   this is the price and the promise of citizenship   this is the source of our confidence    the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny   this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed    why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall  and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath   so let us mark this day with remembrance  of who we are and how far we have traveled  in the year of america s birth  in the coldest of months  a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river  the capital was abandoned  the enemy was advancing  the snow was stained with blood  at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt  the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people    let it be told to the future world     that in the depth of winter  when nothing but hope and virtue could survive     that the city and the country  alarmed at one common danger  came forth to meet     it    america  in the face of our common dangers  in this winter of our hardship  let us remember these timeless words  with hope and virtue  let us brave once more the icy currents  and endure what storms may come  let it be said by our children s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end  that we did not turn back nor did we falter  and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god s grace upon us  we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations   thank you  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america    ',\n",
       " 'thank you  thank you so much   vice president biden  mr  chief justice  members of the united states congress  distinguished guests  and fellow citizens   each time we gather to inaugurate a president we bear witness to the enduring strength of our constitution  we affirm the promise of our democracy  we recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names  what makes us exceptional   what makes us american   is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago   we hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness   today we continue a never ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time  for history tells us that while these truths may be self evident  they ve never been self executing  that while freedom is a gift from god  it must be secured by his people here on earth  the patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob  they gave to us a republic  a government of and by and for the people  entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed   and for more than 200 years  we have   through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword  we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half slave and half free  we made ourselves anew  and vowed to move forward together   together  we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce  schools and colleges to train our workers   together  we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play   together  we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life s worst hazards and misfortune   through it all  we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society s ills can be cured through government alone  our celebration of initiative and enterprise  our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility  these are constants in our character   but we have always understood that when times change  so must we  that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges  that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action  for the american people can no more meet the demands of today s world by acting alone than american soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias  no single person can train all the math and science teachers we ll need to equip our children for the future  or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores  now more than ever  we must do these things together  as one nation and one people   this generation of americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience  a decade of war is now ending  an economic recovery has begun  america s possibilities are limitless  for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands  youth and drive  diversity and openness  an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention  my fellow americans  we are made for this moment and we will seize it   so long as we seize it together   for we  the people  understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it  we believe that america s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class  we know that america thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work  when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship  we are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else  because she is an american  she is free and she is equal  not just in the eyes of god  but also in our own   we understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time  so we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government  revamp our tax code  reform our schools  and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder  learn more  reach higher  but while the means will change  our purpose endures  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single american  that is what this moment requires  that is what will give real meaning to our creed   we  the people  still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity  we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit  but we reject the belief that america must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future  for we remember the lessons of our past  when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn   we do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky  or happiness for the few  we recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives  any one of us at any time may face a job loss or a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm  the commitments we make to each other through medicare and medicaid and social security  these things do not sap our initiative  they strengthen us  they do not make us a nation of takers  they free us to take the risks that make this country great   we  the people  still believe that our obligations as americans are not just to ourselves  but to all posterity  we will respond to the threat of climate change  knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations  some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science  but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms   the path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult  but america cannot resist this transition  we must lead it  we cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries  we must claim its promise  that s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure   our forests and waterways  our crop lands and snow capped peaks  that is how we will preserve our planet  commanded to our care by god  that s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared   we  the people  still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war  our brave men and women in uniform  tempered by the flames of battle  are unmatched in skill and courage  our citizens  seared by the memory of those we have lost  know too well the price that is paid for liberty  the knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm  but we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war  who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends   and we must carry those lessons into this time as well   we will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law  we will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully   not because we are naive about the dangers we face  but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear   america will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe  and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad  for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation  we will support democracy from asia to africa  from the americas to the middle east  because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom  and we must be a source of hope to the poor  the sick  the marginalized  the victims of prejudice   not out of mere charity  but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes  tolerance and opportunity  human dignity and justice   we  the people  declare today that the most evident of truths   that all of us are created equal   is the star that guides us still  just as it guided our forebears through seneca falls and selma and stonewall  just as it guided all those men and women  sung and unsung  who left footprints along this great mall  to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone  to hear a king proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on earth   it is now our generation s task to carry on what those pioneers began  for our journey is not complete until our wives  our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts  our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law   for if we are truly created equal  then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well  our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote  our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving  hopeful immigrants who still see america as a land of opportunity   until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country  our journey is not complete until all our children  from the streets of detroit to the hills of appalachia  to the quiet lanes of newtown  know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm   that is our generation s task   to make these words  these rights  these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american  being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life  it does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness  progress does not compel us to settle centuries long debates about the role of government for all time  but it does require us to act in our time   for now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay  we cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name calling as reasoned debate  we must act  knowing that our work will be imperfect  we must act  we must act knowing that today s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in 4 years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare philadelphia hall   my fellow americans  the oath i have sworn before you today  like the one recited by others who serve in this capitol  was an oath to god and country  not party or faction  and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service  but the words i spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream  my oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride   they are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope  you and i  as citizens  have the power to set this country s course  you and i  as citizens  have the obligation to shape the debates of our time   not only with the votes we cast  but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals   let us  each of us  now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright  with common effort and common purpose  with passion and dedication  let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom   thank you  god bless you  and may he forever bless these united states of america  ',\n",

today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another  but we are transferring power from washington  dc  and giving it back to you  the people   for too long  a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost  washington flourished  but the people did not share in its wealth  politicians prospered  but the jobs left  and the factories closed  the establishment protected itself  but not the citizens of our country  their victories have not been your victories  their triumphs have not been your triumphs  and while they celebrated in our nation s capital  there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land   that all changes  starting right here and right now  because this moment is your moment  it belongs to you  it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america  this is your day  this is your celebration  and this  the united states of america  is your country   what truly matters is not which party controls our government  but whether our government is controlled by the people  january 20  2017  will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again  the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer  everyone is listening to you now   you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before  at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction  that a nation exists to serve its citizens  americans want great schools for their children  safe neighborhoods for their families  and good jobs for themselves  these are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public   but for too many of our citizens  a different reality exists  mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities  rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation  an education system  flush with cash  but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge  and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential   this american carnage stops right here and stops right now  we are one nation  and their pain is our pain  their dreams are our dreams  and their success will be our success  we share one heart  one home  and one glorious destiny   the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans   for many decades  we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry  subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military  we ve defended other nations  borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while america s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay  we ve made other countries rich while the wealth  strength  and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon   one by one  the factories shuttered and left our shores  with not even a thought about the millions and millions of american workers that were left behind  the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world   but that is the past  and now we are looking only to the future   we  assembled here today  are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city  in every foreign capital  and in every hall of power  from this day forward  a new vision will govern our land  from this this day forward  it s going to be only america first  america first   every decision on trade  on taxes  on immigration  on foreign affairs  will be made to benefit american workers and american families   we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products  stealing our companies  and destroying our jobs  protection will lead to great prosperity and strength  i will fight for you with every breath in my body  and i will never  ever let you down   america will start winning again  winning like never before  we will bring back our jobs  we will bring back our borders  we will bring back our wealth  and we will bring back our dreams   we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation   we will get our people off of welfare and back to work  rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor  we will follow two simple rules  buy american and hire american   we will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world  but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first  we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone  but rather to let it shine as an example   we will shine   for everyone to follow   we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism  which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth   at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america  and through our loyalty to our country  we will rediscover our loyalty to each other  when you open your heart to patriotism  there is no room for prejudice  the bible tells us   how good and pleasant it is when god s people live together in unity   we must speak our minds openly  debate our disagreements honestly  but always pursue solidarity  when america is united  america is totally unstoppable  there should be no fear  we are protected  and we will always be protected  we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement  and most importantly  we will be protected by god   finally  we must think big and dream even bigger  in america  we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving   we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action  constantly complaining  but never doing anything about it  the time for empty talk is over  now arrives the hour of action   do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done  no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america  we will not fail  our country will thrive and prosper again   we stand at the birth of a new millennium  ready to unlock the mysteries of space  to free the earth from the miseries of disease  and to harness the energies  industries  and technologies of tomorrow  a new national pride will stir our souls  lift our sights  and heal our divisions   it s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget  that whether we are black or brown or white  we all bleed the same red blood of patriots  we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms  and we all salute the same great american flag   and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska  they look up at the same night sky  they fill their heart with the same dreams  and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator   so to all americans in every city near and far  small and large  from mountain to mountain  from ocean to ocean  hear these words  you will never be ignored again  your voice  your hopes  and your dreams will define our american destiny  and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way   together  we will make america strong again  we will make america wealthy again  we will make america proud again  we will make america safe again   and  yes  together  we will make america great again  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america  thank you  god bless america  ',\n",
       " 'chief justice roberts  vice president harris  speaker pelosi  leader schumer  leader mcconnell  vice president pence  and my distinguished guests  and my fellow americans  this is america s day  this is democracy s day  a day of history and hope  of renewal and resolve  through a crucible for the ages america has been tested anew  and america has risen to the challenge   today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate  but of a cause  the cause of democracy  the people   the will of the people has been heard  and the will of the people has been heeded  we ve learned again that democracy is precious  democracy is fragile  and at this hour  my friends  democracy has prevailed   so now  on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the capitol s very foundation  we come together as one nation under god  indivisible  to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries  as we look ahead in our uniquely american way   restless  bold  optimistic   and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be  i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today  i thank them from the bottom of my heart  and i know the resilience of our constitution and the strength  the strength of our nation  as does president carter  who i spoke with last night  who cannot be with us today  but whom we salute for his lifetime of service   i have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots have taken  the oath first sworn by george washington  but the american story depends not on any one of us  not on some of us  but on all of us  on  we the people   who seek a more perfect union   this is a great nation  we are good people  over the centuries  through storm and strife  in peace and in war  we ve come so far  but we still have far to go  we ll press forward with speed and urgency  for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities  much to repair  much to restore  much to heal  much to build  and much to gain   few people in our nation s history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we re in now  a once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii  millions of jobs have been lost  hundreds of thousands of businesses closed  a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us  the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer  a cry for survival comes from the planet itself  a cry that can t be any more desperate or any more clear  and now  a rise of political extremism  white supremacy  domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat   to overcome these challenges   to restore the soul and secure the future of america   requires so much more than words  it requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy  unity  unity   in another january on new year s day in 1863  abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation  when he put pen to paper  the president said  and i quote   if my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act  and my whole soul is in it   my whole soul is in it   today  on this january day  my whole soul is in this  bringing america together  uniting our people  uniting our nation  and i ask every american to join me in this cause  uniting to fight the foes we face  anger  resentment  and hatred  extremism  lawlessness  violence  disease  joblessness  and hopelessness   with unity we can do great things  important things  we can right wrongs  we can put people to work in good jobs  we can teach our children in safe schools  we can overcome the deadly virus  we can reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all  we can deliver racial justice  and we can make america  once again  the leading force for good in the world   i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days  i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real  but i also know they are not new  our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh  ugly reality that racism  nativism  fear  demonization have long torn us apart  the battle is perennial  and victory is never assured   through the civil war  the great depression  world war  9 11  through struggle  sacrifice  and setbacks  our  better angels  have always prevailed  in each of these moments  enough of us   enough of us   have come together to carry all of us forward  and we can do that now  history  faith  and reason show the way  the way of unity   we can see each other not as adversaries  but as neighbors  we can treat each other with dignity and respect  we can join forces  stop the shouting  and lower the temperature  for without unity  there is no peace  only bitterness and fury  no progress  only exhausting outrage  no nation  only a state of chaos   this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge  and unity is the path forward  and we must meet this moment as the united states of america  if we do that  i guarantee you  we will not fail  we have never  ever  ever  ever failed in america when we have acted together   and so today  at this time  in this place  let s start afresh  all of us  let s begin to listen to one another  hear one another  see one another  show respect to one another  politics doesn t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path  every disagreement doesn t have to be a cause for total war  and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured   my fellow americans  we have to be different than this  america has to be better than this  and i believe america is so much better than this   just look around  here we stand  in the shadow of the capitol dome  as was mentioned earlier  completed amid the civil war  when the union itself was literally hanging in the balance  yet we endured  we prevailed   here we stand looking out on the great mall where dr  king spoke of his dream   here we stand  where 108 years ago  at another inaugural  thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote  and today we mark the swearing in of the first woman in american history elected to national office  vice president kamala harris  don t tell me things can t change   here we stand across the potomac from arlington cemetery  where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace   and here we stand  just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people  to stop the work of our democracy  to drive us from this sacred ground  it did not happen  it will never happen  not today  not tomorrow  not ever   not ever   to all those who supported our campaign  i am humbled by the faith you ve placed in us  to all those who did not support us  let me say this  hear me out as we move forward  take a measure of me and my heart  and if you still disagree  so be it  that s democracy  that s america  the right to dissent peaceably  within the guardrails of our republic  is perhaps this nation s greatest strength  yet hear me clearly  disagreement must not lead to disunion  and i pledge this to you  i will be a president for all americans   all americans  and i promise you  i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did   many centuries ago  saint augustine  a saint of my church  wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love   defined by the common objects of their love  what are the common objects we as americans love  that define us as americans  i think we know  opportunity  security  liberty  dignity  respect  honor  and yes  the truth   recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson  there is truth  and there are lies  lies told for power and for profit  and each of us has a duty and a responsibility  as citizens  as americans  and especially as leaders   leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation   to defend the truth and defeat the lies   look  i understand that many of my fellow americans view the future with fear and trepidation  i understand they worry about their jobs  i understand  like my dad  they lay at bed at night staring at the ceiling  wondering   can i keep my health care  can i pay my mortgage   thinking about their families  about what comes next  i promise you  i get it  but the answer is not to turn inward  to retreat into competing factions  distrusting those who don t look like you or worship the way you do or don t get their news from the same sources you do  we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue  rural versus urban  conservative versus liberal  we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts  if we show a little tolerance and humility  and if we re willing to stand in the other person s shoes  as my mom would say  just for a moment  stand in their shoes   because here is the thing about life  there is no accounting for what fate will deal you  some days when you need a hand  there are other days when we re called to lend a hand  that s how it has to be  that is what we do for one another  and if we are this way  our country will be stronger  more prosperous  more ready for the future  and we can still disagree   my fellow americans  in the work ahead of us  we re going to need each other  we need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter  we re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus  we must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation  one nation  and i promise you this  as the bible says   weeping may endure for a night  but joy cometh in the morning   we will get through this  together   together   look  folks  all my colleagues that i served with in the house and the senate up here  we all understand the world is watching  watching all of us today  so here is my message to those beyond our borders  america has been tested  and we have come out stronger for it  we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again  not to meet yesterday s challenges  but today s and tomorrow s challenges  and we ll lead not merely by the example of our power  but by the power of our example  we will be a strong and trusted partner for peace  progress  and security   look  you all know  we have been through so much in this nation  and  in my first act as president  i d like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic  those 400 000 fellow americans  moms  dads  husbands  wives  sons  daughters  friends  neighbors  and coworkers  we will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be   so i ask you  let s say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives  for those they left behind  and for our country    at this point  a moment of silence was observed    amen   folks  this is a time of testing  we face an attack on our democracy and on truth  a raging virus  growing inequity  the sting of systemic racism  a climate in crisis  america s role in the world  any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways  but the fact is  we face them all at once  presenting this nation with one of the gravest of responsibilities we ve had   now we re going to be tested  are we going to step up  all of us  it is time for boldness  for there is so much to do  and this is certain  i promise you  we will be judged  you and i  by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era  will we rise to the occasion  is the question  will we master this rare and difficult hour  will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children  i believe we must  i m sure you do as well  i believe we will   and when we do  we will write the next great chapter in the history of the united states of america  the american story  a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me  it s called  american anthem   and there s one verse that stands out  at least for me  and it goes like this    the work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day what shall be our legacy  what will our children say        let me know in my heart when my days are through america  america  i gave my best to you    let s add   let s us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation  if we do this  then when our days are through  our children and our children s children will say of us   they gave their best  they did their duty  they healed a broken land    my fellow americans  i close today where i began  with a sacred oath  before god and all of you i give you my word  i will always level with you  i will defend the constitution  i will defend our democracy  i will defend america  and i will give all  all of you  keep everything you   i do  in your service  thinking not of power  but of possibilities  not of personal interest  but of the public good  and together  we shall write an american story of hope  not fear  of unity  not division  of light  not darkness  a story of decency and dignity  love and healing  greatness and goodness   may this be the story that guides us  the story that inspires us  and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history  we met the moment  democracy and hope  truth and justice  did not die on our watch  but thrived  that america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world  that is what we owe our forebearers  one another  and generations to follow   so with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time  sustained by faith  driven by conviction  and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts   may god bless america  and may god protect our troops  thank you  america  ']"

This made sense to me - it was early in American history and we had only recently left British rule. But, I was curious to see whether or not 'british' would show up uniquely (albeit less uniquely) in any later addresses. **Generate a line plot that plots the TF-IDF value for the column name `'british'` on the y-axis.
