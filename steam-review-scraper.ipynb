I love Fromsoft and all it\\'s games. DS1 and Elden Ring are Masterpieces. Demons Souls, DS3 and  Bloodblourne are all Very good. But this is just the worst of the franchise and by a wide margin. Here\\'s a great many reasons why. You can only level up at one bonfire in Majula by talking to the one Firekeeper. Health restoring items take a long time to recharge your health and you only get 1 estus flask to begin with. So finding windows to heal en-midst a tense fight is way harder. They separated the Stamina and Weight Capacity stats so now you have to separately level those. The stamina bar also depletes way faster so you can\\'t even get through 2 chains without having to back off and wait even with almost 30 END. The Blacksmith can\\'t craft the Boss weapons anymore, you have find the specific vendors out in the wild that carry the specific one your looking for. You get invaded by other players even while hollowed. Then there\\'s the Health depletion mechanic. Die and your health bar is reduced. Die too often and your health is Halved. Use an effigy to get it back but use all the ones you\\'ve got and your up a creek without a paddle. The controls are considerably worse. Sometimes functions take several clicks just to work properly. Everything is stiffer. All animations are dragged out way longer. There\\'s way fewer I-Frames on the dodge mechanics so you get clipped way more often and launched if you dodge the wrong way. The hit boxes are way bigger in general so you just get smacked around lot more. A LOT of DS1 is copy pasted in here including plenty of armor and weapons and entire bosses. The level design is noticeably worse with more claustrophobic enclosures. The scenery is worse in general regardless of the poorer graphics. One of the worst changes is the shear amount of enemies. After a bit, they just start dog piling you with overpowered enemies. Like, they will have you drop into the middle of a balancing platform section with some platforms falling out from underneath you, and surround you with 3 quick knights, 2 greatbow snipers, 3 big knights and fire spouts everywhere shooting up, all of which kill you in 2-3 hits. Like I\\'ve played Fromsoft games for years and I understand fair difficulty. This isn\\'t just a case of \\\\\"Get better and in time you\\'ll be able to breeze through it\\\\\". This is more like, GOOD LUCK, *Slams door* and fifty overpowered and giant enemies beat you down into the dirt. And again, I could stomach it if they\\'d have just brought the mechanics and controls over from the first one. If it still felt tight and were complimented by your snap reflexes. As it stands, this has been the one that felt the most like a chore to complete. They made it way harder and then way harder to play it, too. So no I don\\'t recommend it. I\\'ll probably never play it again but I am gonna go back play DS1 to wash the taste out.\",\"timestamp_created\":1703046576,\"timestamp_updated\":1703783060,\"voted_up\":false,\"votes_up\":4,\"votes_funny\":2,\"weighted_vote_score\":\"0.539923965930938721\",\"comment_count\":0,\"steam_purchase\":true,\"received_for_free\":false,\"written_during_early_access\":false,\"hidden_in_steam_china\":true,\"steam_china_location\":\"\"},{\"recommendationid\":\"154444566\",\"author\":{\"steamid\":\"76561198976770859\",\"num_games_owned\":134,\"num_reviews\":33,\"playtime_forever\":16751,\"playtime_last_two_weeks\":778,\"playtime_at_review\":16105,\"last_played\":1703775491},\"language\":\"english\",\"review\":\"Nah, I\\'d win.\",\"timestamp_created\":1703590701,\"timestamp_updated\":1703590701,\"voted_up\":true,\"votes_up\":2,\"votes_funny\":0,\"weighted_vote_score\":\"0.539325833320617676\",\"comment_count\":0,\"steam_purchase\":true,\"received_for_free\":false,\"written_during_early_access\":false,\"hidden_in_steam_china\":true,\"steam_china_location\":\"\"},{\"recommendationid\":\"154092385\",\"author\":{\"steamid\":\"76561198075082656\",\"num_games_owned\":0,\"num_reviews\":77,\"playtime_forever\":2843,\"playtime_last_two_weeks\":0,\"playtime_at_review\":2843,\"last_played\":1703200253},\"language\":\"english\",\"review\":\"It has some questionable design decisions but overall it\\'s still a solid entry in Souls franchise, 8/10\",\"timestamp_created\":1703200433,\"timestamp_updated\":1703200433,\"voted_up\":true,\"votes_up\":7,\"votes_funny\":0,\"weighted_vote_score\":\"0.538709700107574463\",\"comment_count\":0,\"steam_purchase\":true,\"received_for_free\":false,\"written_during_early_access\":false,\"hidden_in_steam_china\":true,\"steam_china_location\":\"\"},{\"recommendationid\":\"155346900\",\"author\":{\"steamid\":\"76561198825749301\",\"num_games_owned\":33,\"num_reviews\":7,\"playtime_forever\":13824,\"playtime_last_two_weeks\":5244,\"playtime_at_review\":13824,\"last_played\":1704498846},\"language\":\"english\",\"review\":\"best in the trilogy\",\"timestamp_created\":1704498864,\"timestamp_updated\":1704498864,\"voted_up\":true,\"votes_up\":1,\"votes_funny\":0,\"weighted_vote_score\":\"0.525862038135528564\",\"comment_count\":0,\"steam_purchase\":true,\"received_for_free\":false,\"written_during_early_access\":false,\"hidden_in_steam_china\":true,\"steam_china_location\":\"\"},{\"recommendationid\":\"155104543\",\"author\":{\"steamid\":\"76561198127323601\",\"num_games_owned\":0,\"num_reviews\":86,\"playtime_forever\":2671,\"playtime_last_two_weeks\":0,\"playtime_at_review\":2671,\"last_played\":1677196178},\"language\":\"english\",\"review\":\"Loved DS2 way more than one, it was tons of fun!

This could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your approach to the series.\\\\n\\\\nThe bosses can also feel a little samey (design wise).

Dark Souls II is not a bad game as many make it out to be. It\\'s actually a pretty great game even with all its faults (which are many). Now, Scholar of the First Sin is not a good version. The original Dark Souls II was unforgiving enough, especially in levels like Shrine of Amana, which is basically hell made game. FromSoftware had the opportunity to correct the mistakes, make the game not easy, but more fair (because it is the only Souls that I consider unfair). Yet they decided to make the game worse. Tiny levels like Earthen Peak have a ridiculous amount of enemies that are fast, once they get you you\\'re sure to be hit around three times and be inflicted with poison. In The Iron Keep you have four enemies in the first room and seven more after that and not counting some that are shooting arrows from the distance, and they all come for you almost at the same time. From a design perspective, it\\'s bad because you can\\'t reach all of them soon enough before they send you to God and the tools they give do not help. FromSoftware actually pretends that each time you lose to a boss you kill each and every last one of the enemies you come across before entering the boss room again, and that almost always means killing +7 enemies that are close to each other. You may think it\\'s just me having skill issues, but like I said, I played the original version of this game and did everything it had to offer and loved it, not to forget that up until now I have also played Elden Ring and Dark Souls I and III and none made me feel as frustrated as this version of Dark Souls II. The real question you should ask yourself is: Do I want to play a prettier version or the better designed version of the game?\\\\nI really recommend you to play the original version first if you have an Xbox 360 lying around or buy it on Steam, it\\'s available as well.
